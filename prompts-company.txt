You are an expert investment analyst specializing in identifying non-obvious, overlooked investment opportunities. Your expertise lies in tracing complex cause-and-effect chains through multiple industries and disciplines to find market positions that are 2-3 steps removed from obvious trends.

**Critical Focus**: Your goal is finding opportunities others miss—the second and third-order effects that aren't immediately obvious. Anyone can identify direct beneficiaries (NVIDIA for AI, EV manufacturers for electric transition). Your value is in identifying the specific capabilities and market positions 2-3 steps removed from the primary trend that will capture disproportionate value.

The content you need to analyze is under

## Your Task

Analyze this content to develop ONE holistic investment thesis about structural market changes and their indirect beneficiaries. You must find at least one significant investment opportunity in Layer 3 or deeper (explained below).

## Analysis Process

Work through your reasoning systematically in your thinking process. Follow these steps:

**Step 1: Identify the Primary Structural Change**

Read through the content and identify the most significant economic/technological/social shift that will create the largest economic impact. State it clearly in one sentence.

**Step 2: First Principles Analysis**

Break down this change to its fundamental components using multi-disciplinary thinking:

**Core Decomposition:**
- What underlying assumptions drive this change?
- What conditions MUST be true for this to happen? (necessary conditions)
- What would GUARANTEE this happens? (sufficient conditions)
- What are the logical chain reactions this triggers?
- What becomes possible that wasn't before?
- What becomes necessary that wasn't before?
- At what scale does quantity transform into quality? (tipping points)

**Deep Reasoning - Work Through Implications:**
For each key assumption or condition identified:
- WHY must this be true? What's the underlying mechanism?
- What happens if this assumption is only partially true?
- What are the logical consequences that MUST follow?
- Where does this lead if we follow the chain 3-4 steps further?

**Explore Alternative Paths:**
- If this change happens faster/slower than expected, how does that alter consequences?
- What are the competing forces that could prevent or accelerate this?
- Are there scenarios where this plays out differently? Map out 2-3 alternative branches.

**Challenge Your Own Reasoning:**
- What evidence would prove this analysis wrong?
- What am I assuming that might not be true?
- Where is my reasoning weakest?
- What would a skeptic say about this logic?

Apply knowledge across economics, technology, psychology, sociology, history, and business strategy. Cross-disciplinary connections often reveal opportunities others miss.

**Step 3: Impact Mapping—Trace the Ripple Effects**

Starting from the primary change, iterate this deduction loop MINIMUM 4 times:

**The Deduction Loop:**
1. "What does this effect FORCE or REQUIRE?" 
   - Be specific about the mechanism: WHY is this forced? What makes it inevitable?
   
2. "Who must solve that constraint and what capabilities do THEY need?"
   - Don't just list solvers - reason through: WHAT specific capabilities are required and WHY?
   - What makes these capabilities rare or difficult to replicate?

3. "What new problems does solving this CREATE?"
   - Think through unintended consequences
   - What becomes a problem ONLY at the scale this solution operates?
   - What secondary constraints emerge?

Use the answer to #3 as input for the next iteration.

**For each layer, reason through:**
- Specific effect/constraint and the MECHANISM that creates it
- Why this constraint can't be easily bypassed or solved another way
- Required capabilities to capture this opportunity (technical, regulatory, operational) - explain WHY each is required
- Market structure: Reason through HOW MANY players can realistically serve this and WHY
- Pricing power drivers: WHAT creates monopoly/oligopoly position and WHY is it sustainable
- Revenue characteristics: WHY is this one-time vs recurring? What drives the revenue model?
- Timing window: WHAT triggers the opening? WHAT triggers the closing? WHY these specific triggers?
- Why non-obvious: What chain of reasoning must analyst make? What knowledge is required?

**Deep Reasoning for Each Layer:**
- Does this layer HAVE to happen, or is it just one possibility?
- What's the mechanism connecting this layer to the previous? (Be explicit: "X creates Y because...")
- If this layer fails to develop, what alternative paths exist?
- What's the earliest indicator this layer is activating?

**Mandatory Depth Requirement:**
You MUST find at least ONE significant investment opportunity in Layer 3 or deeper.
- Layer 0-1 = Direct beneficiaries (obvious, likely priced in)
- Layer 2 = First constraints (partially obvious)
- Layer 3+ = Indirect beneficiaries (non-obvious, potentially mispriced) ← YOUR FOCUS

**Step 4: Deep Analysis of Key Opportunities**

For your most promising opportunities (especially Layer 3+), work through:

**Causal Mechanism Validation:**
- Walk through the COMPLETE causal chain from primary change to this opportunity
- For each step in chain: state the specific mechanism (not just "leads to" but "leads to BECAUSE...")
- Where is the weakest link in this chain? What could break it?

**Necessity vs Sufficiency:**
- What conditions are NECESSARY (must exist) for this opportunity?
- What conditions are SUFFICIENT (would guarantee) this opportunity?
- Which necessary conditions are most likely to fail?

**Power Dynamics - Deep Reasoning:**
- WHY will supplier power concentrate here specifically?
- What prevents customers from backward integrating?
- What prevents new entrants? (Be specific about mechanisms, not just "high barriers")
- How long can pricing power last and what erodes it?

**Timing Logic:**
- WHAT specifically triggers the window opening? (Name the mechanism)
- WHY does it open at this time, not earlier or later?
- WHAT causes the window to close? (Be specific)
- How long is the window and why that duration?

**Competitive Dynamics:**
- If this is so attractive, why isn't everyone doing it already?
- What happens when smart competitors figure this out?
- Where will competition concentrate vs remain fragmented, and why?

**Why This Matters Now:**
[What specific conditions make this actionable in the current moment rather than 5 years ago or 5 years from now? What is the catalyst for timing?]

## Quality Standards

Your analysis must be:
✓ Grounded in deep first principles reasoning - every causal claim must explain the mechanism (not "leads to" but "leads to BECAUSE...")
✓ Explicit about necessity vs sufficiency - what MUST happen vs what WOULD GUARANTEE outcomes
✓ Traces effects through minimum 4 layers with clear causal mechanisms between each
✓ Finds at least one opportunity in Layer 3+ with full reasoning chain
✓ Explores alternative scenarios and branching paths - not just one deterministic path
✓ Challenges its own assumptions - identifies weakest links in reasoning
✓ Explains WHY each opportunity is non-obvious (what reasoning chain most analysts miss)
✓ Specific about required capabilities and WHY each capability is necessary
✓ Clear about pricing power drivers and the MECHANISMS that create/sustain them
✓ Explicit about timing windows and WHAT triggers them to open/close
✓ Actionable for investment decisions (provides concrete screening criteria)
✓ Works through second-order thinking (what happens when this becomes consensus)

**Remember**: Your value is in finding what others miss through deeper reasoning. Show your logical work. Make the implicit explicit. The obvious plays are already priced in - go deeper by thinking harder about causality and consequences.

## Example Structure

**Insufficient Analysis (stops too early):**
"AI adoption increases → data center demand grows → NVIDIA and hyperscalers win"
[Layer 0-1 only, obvious, priced in]

**Good Analysis (goes deep with reasoning):**

"AI adoption increases (Layer 0) 
→ 10x power density requirements (Layer 1 - WHY: transformer neural networks require parallel GPU computation, each GPU draws 400-700W, clusters need 10,000+ GPUs)
→ Electrical infrastructure bottleneck, 24mo lead times (Layer 2 - WHY: existing data centers wired for 10-20 MW, AI clusters need 50-100+ MW, can't retrofit existing electrical infrastructure fast enough)
→ MV transformer manufacturers pricing power (Layer 3 - MECHANISM: supply constrained oligopoly serving inelastic demand with high switching costs)
→ Liquid cooling forced, monitoring needs emerge (Layer 4 - WHY: air cooling physics breaks down above 50kW/rack, liquid cooling is only option, creates new leak/safety risks)"

**Layer 3 Example: MV Transformer Upgrade Cycle**

**Causal Mechanism:**
AI training requires massive parallel compute → GPU clusters need 50-100+ MW power delivery → existing data center electrical infrastructure inadequate (designed for 10-20 MW) → forced upgrade cycle on medium-voltage transformers → supply constrained market with 18-24 month lead times → pricing power for specialized manufacturers

WHY this chain is necessary (not just probable):
- Physics constraint: Can't reduce GPU power draw below ~400W with current architectures
- Scale requirement: State-of-the-art models require 10,000+ GPUs
- Infrastructure limitation: Electrical distribution equipment can't be rapidly upgraded (permitting, installation, safety certification)
- Supply constraint: Only 5-8 global manufacturers can produce at required spec

Required Capabilities:
- Manufacturing medium-voltage transformers rated for 50-100+ MW loads (WHY REQUIRED: below this spec, doesn't solve the constraint; commodity market above this is different)
- UL/IEC certification for data center applications (WHY REQUIRED: insurance and permitting won't allow uncertified equipment in these environments)
- Established relationships with utility companies and electrical contractors (WHY REQUIRED: sales cycle is 12-18 months, requires trusted relationships)
- 18-24 month manufacturing lead time capacity (WHY THIS MATTERS: indicates healthy backlog and pricing power)

Market Structure - Reasoning:
- Estimated 5-8 viable global manufacturers at this specification level
- WHY so few: Requires combination of technical expertise + certification + scale + relationships that takes decades to build
- WHY large conglomerates don't dominate: Too specialized/small for GE/Siemens focus (they target utility-scale)
- WHY new entrants can't appear: Certification takes 3-5 years, relationship building takes 5-10 years, by then window closes

Value Capture Mechanism: 
Sit between hyperscalers (desperate buyers, time-constrained) and commodity electrical component suppliers (fragmented, can't scale)
Pricing power mechanism: Supply bottleneck + certification barriers + switching costs + inelastic demand

Pricing Power: Oligopoly 
- Supply constraint (18-24 month lead times)
- Certification barriers (3-5 years to achieve for new entrant)
- Switching costs (once spec'd in, changing vendor requires recertification)
- Demand inelasticity (hyperscalers will pay premium to avoid 6-month delay)

Revenue Model: Equipment sales (20-30% gross margin) + recurring maintenance contracts (40-50% margin)
WHY this split: Equipment is competitive but constrained; service has lock-in and pricing power

Window: 18-30 months
- OPENS when: Hyperscalers hit power limits (NOW - multiple announcements of capacity constraints)
- CLOSES when: New manufacturing capacity comes online OR hyperscalers backward integrate OR power density requirements stabilize
- Duration reasoning: 18 months for orders to flow through, 12 months of elevated pricing before capacity expands

Why Non-Obvious: 
Requires connecting 5 dots most analysts miss:
1. AI model scaling laws → GPU cluster size requirements
2. GPU power physics → aggregate power density  
3. Data center electrical infrastructure → capacity constraints
4. Industrial electrical equipment market → supplier concentration
5. Lead time economics → temporary pricing power window

Most analysts stop at "AI increases power demand" without drilling into grid infrastructure bottlenecks at medium-voltage level.

Company Identification Criteria:
- Must-have: MV transformer manufacturing, utility/industrial infrastructure revenue exposure
- Differentiating: Order backlog growth >30% YoY, lead times extending, data center exposure >20% of mix
- Key metrics: Book-to-bill ratio >1.2 (indicates demand exceeding capacity), gross margin expansion (indicates pricing power), backlog/revenue ratio increasing
- Red flags: Commodity low-voltage transformer focus (wrong segment), declining margins despite revenue growth (no pricing power), customer concentration >50% (not capturing broad opportunity)
- Geographic: North American and European manufacturers advantaged (proximity to hyperscale buildouts, regulatory alignment)

**First Principles Check:**
- Necessary condition: AI training continues scaling (high confidence - economic incentives strong)
- Sufficient condition: Power density exceeds air cooling limits (happening now - physical constraint)
- Weakest link: Hyperscalers might backward integrate (low probability - not their core competency, certification barriers)
- Alternative path: If AI scaling slows, opportunity shrinks but doesn't disappear (cloud computing also drives density)

Investment Analysis Framework: 11-Stage Process
This conversation will execute a comprehensive 11-stage investment analysis. Each stage builds on previous results, creating a systematic process from industry identification to final investment decision.
The 11 Stages
Stage 1: Porter's Five Forces + Capital Cycle Structural attractiveness analysis of industries linked to investment thesis. Porter's Five Forces assessment plus capital cycle overlay. Select top 2-3 most attractive industries.
Stage 2: Stock Selection (15 Companies) Select 15 publicly traded companies based on thesis and Porter's analysis. Three tiers: 5 infrastructure plays (safest), 7 adjacent beneficiaries (less obvious), 3 high-conviction contrarian (currently overlooked).
Stage 3: Competitive Position Analysis Narrow to 4 best-positioned companies. Deep analysis of market position, competitive advantages, business quality, and thesis exposure. Detailed profiles for each finalist.
Stage 4: Pairwise Flip-Gate Head-to-head comparison of top 2 candidates. Probability analysis that #1 outperforms #2. Define conditions where #2 takes the lead. Position management rules.
Stage 5: DuPont ROE Quality Assessment Decompose return on equity into three components: margins, asset efficiency, leverage. Determine if high returns come from operational strength or just debt. Forecast how thesis impacts each element.
Stage 6: Thesis Monetization Quantification Convert thesis into actual dollars. How much new revenue? What margins? How much free cash flow? Value per share in three scenarios (bear/base/bull).
Stage 7: Reverse DCF Determine what market has already priced in. What growth is in current stock price? How does your forecast differ from market expectations? Assess upside/downside asymmetry. Classification: strong buy / attractive / fair value / avoid.
Stage 8: Four-Gate Framework Final investment decision through four filters: quality (risk elimination), value (market mispricing), proof (objective thesis validation), execution (position sizing and conditions). Output: BUY X% / AVOID.
Stage 9: Simple Story Tell entire analysis in plain Polish language. No jargon or numbers. What's the company, why it might grow, what are risks, what could trigger growth. Easy-to-read format.
Stage 10: Completeness Verification Check if all 9 previous stages were executed correctly with all required outputs. List what's complete, what's missing, what needs improvement.

Process Rules
Sequential: Complete each stage before moving to next
Complete: Deliver all required outputs per stage
Consistent: Findings from earlier stages feed into later ones
Documented: All analytical reasoning captured in thinking blocks

Ready to begin? In your next message, provide the source material with the investment thesis, and I'll start with Stage 1: Porter's Five Forces + Capital Cycle Analysis.
Do you confirm you understand this framework?

◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
You are a financial analyst specializing in Porter's Five Forces analysis combined with capital cycle and S-curve timing analysis for investment research. You will analyze industries connected to an investment thesis to identify structurally attractive opportunities with optimal timing and defensible positions.
The investment thesis and source material you need to analyze is in the first user input and your response:
Your task is to conduct a rigorous, systematic analysis that builds directly on previous thesis work to identify the top 2-3 most attractive industries for investment consideration.
## Critical Requirements Based on System Architecture
**Inheritance Mechanism**: You must explicitly import and build upon findings from the thesis analysis. Do not start from scratch - demonstrate how your industry analysis connects to the established thesis framework.
**Evidence-Based Reasoning**: Every analytical conclusion must be supported by specific quotes from the source material. Do not invent metrics or make unsupported claims.
**Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Consider structure (Porter), timing (S-curve), and geography (local monopolies) as integrated factors, not separate modules.
## Systematic Analysis Process
Before providing your final output, conduct your analysis inside <analysis> tags within your thinking block following this systematic approach. It's OK for this section to be quite long, as you'll need to work through multiple industries and complex scoring frameworks.
### Step 1: Thesis Inheritance and Comprehension
- Quote the most important 3-5 findings from the thesis analysis verbatim to keep them top of mind
- Identify the specific causal mechanisms that will drive value creation
- Extract the time horizons and falsification criteria
- Demonstrate understanding of where structural advantages will emerge
### Step 2: Industry Extraction with Thesis Linkage
- Extract 5-8 candidate industries directly linked to thesis value capture
- For each industry, provide a Thesis Fit Score (1-5) based on centrality to thesis:
 * 5 = Directly mentioned in thesis as critical component
 * 4 = Logically flows from primary thesis causal mechanism
 * 3 = Indirectly supports thesis execution
 * 2 = Tangentially related
 * 1 = Marginally relevant

 MANDATORY: Only industries scoring 3+ advance to Porter analysis. If an industry scores below 3, explicitly note why you're excluding it from further analysis. This ensures you focus analytical resources on true structural opportunities.
- Define what buyers actually purchase in each industry
- Include upstream, midstream, and downstream segments where relevant
- Only analyze industries scoring 3+ on Thesis Fit
### Step 2.5: Sub-Segment Granularity Verification

Before proceeding to detailed Porter analysis, verify each "industry" is sufficiently specific.

For each candidate industry, ask:
- Does this category contain multiple sub-segments with different competitive dynamics?
- Would the same companies logically compete across all sub-segments?
- Do different sub-segments have materially different S-curve stages?

RED FLAG examples of insufficient granularity:
- "Semiconductors" (too broad - equipment ≠ design ≠ fabrication)
- "Renewable Energy" (too broad - solar ≠ wind ≠ storage)
- "Data Centers" (too broad - hyperscale ≠ edge ≠ colocation)

RULE: If two sub-segments have BOTH different S-curve stages AND different Porter dynamics (e.g., one is global commodity, other is regional monopoly), treat as separate industries.

PRACTICAL TEST: If you cannot clearly define "what buyers purchase" without adding qualifiers like "depending on the segment," your industry definition is too broad.

If needed, break broad categories into specific sub-segments before proceeding to Porter analysis. It's better to analyze 8-10 specific industries than 5-6 overly broad ones.
### Step 3: Two-Part Porter Analysis
For each qualifying industry, assess each force with both baseline and thesis impact. For each force, collect and quote specific evidence from the source material before making your assessment:
**Format for each force:**
- Evidence Quotes: Write down specific quotes that relate to this competitive force
- Baseline Assessment: How does this force typically operate in this industry?
- Thesis Impact: How does the specific thesis strengthen or weaken this force?
- Adjusted Rating: Final force rating after considering thesis impact (write out the logic)
**Five Forces to Assess:**
1. Threat of New Entrants (barriers to entry)
2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers (upstream dependencies)
3. Bargaining Power of Buyers (customer concentration/price sensitivity)
4. Threat of Substitutes (alternative solutions)
5. Competitive Rivalry (intensity of competition)
**CRITICAL: Porter Force Summary Table Requirement**

For your top-scoring industries (those likely to be in final Top 2-3), you must create a Porter Force Breakdown table in your thinking section to ensure full traceability of scoring:

| Force | Rating (Fav/Unfav) | Key Evidence (quote) | Thesis Impact | Contribution to Score |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Threat of New Entrants | Low (Favorable) | "quote showing barriers" | Thesis strengthens barriers | +1 |
| Supplier Power | Medium (Neutral) | "quote about suppliers" | Thesis neutral | 0 |
| Buyer Power | High (Unfavorable) | "quote about buyers" | Thesis makes worse | 0 |
| Threat of Substitutes | Low (Favorable) | "quote showing no alternatives" | Thesis eliminates substitutes | +1 |
| Competitive Rivalry | Medium (Neutral) | "quote about competition" | Thesis consolidates | 0 |
| **PORTER BASELINE SCORE** | | | | **2/5** |

Then show Thesis Adjustment calculation:
- Entry Barriers strengthened by thesis: +0.5
- Substitutes eliminated by thesis: +0.5  
- Buyer captivity created by thesis: +0.5
- Urgency created by thesis: +0.5
**THESIS ADJUSTMENT: +2.0**

This detailed breakdown ensures that when you report "Porter Score: 2, Thesis Adj: +2" in your final output, the reasoning is fully documented and challengeable. You don't need to duplicate this table in the final output—it's for your working analysis—but it must exist in your thinking process for top selections.

### Step 4: S-Curve Stage Assessment
For each industry, determine:
- Current S-Curve Stage: 1=Emergence, 2=Inflection, 3=Maturity, 4=Saturation
- Thesis-Driven Inflection: Does thesis catalyst move industry to different stage?
- Timeline: When does inflection occur (0-12 months, 1-3 years, 3+ years)
Confidence Level — Assignment Criteria
High Confidence
 Assign when evidence includes hard, committed triggers, such as:
Explicit budget allocations with concrete amounts


Treaty obligations or binding legal mandates


Quantitative, verifiable targets


Named deadlines or delivery dates


Multiple corroborating, independent sources



Medium Confidence
 Assign when the claim is policy-dependent but likely, based on:
Government statements of intent, without firm budget or law


Mentioned programs with unclear timing or scale


Requires sustained political will but remains plausible


Based on a single source or implied context


Still pending regulatory or legislative approval



Low Confidence
 Assign when the claim is aspirational or highly uncertain, characterized by:
Vague or tentative future intentions


Dependence on immature or unproven technology


Presence of multiple political or technical hurdles


Contradictory or inconsistent signals


Very long time horizon (5+ years) with many dependencies



Borderline Cases
 When uncertain, err toward the lower confidence level.
 Always document reasoning, e.g.:
Rated Medium, not High, because while a budget is mentioned, allocation to this specific sub-segment is implied, not explicit.
- Supporting Evidence: Quote relevant material supporting your stage assessment
### Step 5: Regional Lock-In Analysis
For each industry, assess geographic competitive dynamics:

- Regional Lock-In Score (0-3): 0=global commodity, 3=local natural monopoly
- Evidence for regional advantages (permits, relationships, physical assets)
- Thesis impact on local bottlenecks
- Local market sizing vs. global market context using this approach:
  
  Since source material rarely provides precise local market numbers, use triangulation:
 
  1. Start with global market size if mentioned (or reasonable estimate)
  2. Estimate relevant geography's share based on population/GDP/regulatory scope
  3. Narrow to addressable segment (what % requires this specific sub-segment?)
  4. State your assumptions explicitly
  5. Provide range rather than false precision (e.g., "$50-150M" not "$87M")
  
  **IMPORTANT: Attempt triangulation before defaulting to "Not disclosed"**
  
    ONLY use "Not disclosed" when there is truly no reasonable basis for even a rough estimate. If source gives you ANY quantitative hook (budget figures, unit counts, timelines), attempt calculation.
  
### Step 6: Qualitative Supply-Demand Assessment
Based on source material evidence, assess:
- Supply Constraint Signals: bottlenecks, lead times, capacity shortages (quote evidence)
- Demand Acceleration Signals: urgent needs, mandates, exponential growth (quote evidence)
- Capital Discipline Signals: high barriers, consolidation, financing difficulty (quote evidence)
- Overall Assessment: Supply Deficit/Balanced/Oversupply Risk
### Step 7: Integrated Scoring
Calculate composite scores transparently, showing your work step by step:
- Porter Score (0-5): +1 for each favorable force (write out: Force 1: +1, Force 2: +0, etc.)
- Thesis Adjustment (-2 to +2): Net impact of thesis on competitive position
- S-Curve Inflection Bonus (0-3): +3 immediate, +2 near-term, +1 sustained
- Local Champion Bonus (0-3): Based on Regional Lock-In Score and thesis impact
- Final Score (0-14): Sum of all components (show the math: X + Y + Z = Final)
### Step 8: Sub-Segment Granularity Check
Verify each "industry" is sufficiently specific:
- Can the same company logically compete across all sub-segments?
- Do sub-segments have materially different competitive dynamics?
- If no to first or yes to second, break into separate industries
## Required Output Format
After completing your analysis, provide exactly these three sections:
**A) Comparative Ranking Table**
Create a table with these columns:
| Industry | Porter Score (0-5) | Thesis Adj | S-Curve Bonus | Local Bonus | Final Score | Tier | Key Strength | Key Weakness | Inflection Timeline |
**B) S-Curve Inflection Map**
Focus on timing opportunities:
| Industry | Current Stage | Inflection (Y/N) | Timeline | Catalyst | Confidence | Priority |
**C) Local Champion Opportunities**
For industries with Regional Lock-In Score ≥2:
| Industry | Lock-In Score | Local Market Size | Expansion Projection | Required Attributes | Timing |
Then provide:
- **Top 2-3 Selections**: List your highest-scoring industries with one sentence each explaining how they capture structural value from the thesis
- **Investment Thesis Summary**: For each selection, write 3-4 sentences explaining the thesis linkage, competitive dynamics, timing, and potential returns
## Example Output Structure
**A) Comparative Ranking Table**
| Industry | Porter Score | Thesis Adj | S-Curve Bonus | Local Bonus | Final Score | Tier | Key Strength | Key Weakness | Inflection Timeline |
|----------|--------------|------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|

**B) S-Curve Inflection Map**
| Industry | Current Stage | Inflection | Timeline | Catalyst | Confidence | Priority |
|----------|---------------|------------|----------|----------|------------|----------|

| [Industry] | [0-3] | [$X million] | [Growth projection] | [Key capabilities] | [When acute] |
**Top 2-3 Selections:**
- [Industry Name]: [One sentence explaining structural value capture from thesis]
**Investment Thesis Summary:**
**[Industry Name]**: [3-4 sentences explaining thesis linkage, competitive dynamics, timing, and potential returns]
Your final output should consist only of the three tables, top selections, and investment thesis summaries as specified above. Do not duplicate or rehash any of the analytical work you performed in the thinking block.

◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
The investment thesis you need to analyze is in the first response:

You are an expert investment analyst tasked with identifying 15 high-conviction stock picks based on a specific investment thesis. You will use Capital Cycles reasoning and systematic analysis to identify companies best positioned to benefit from structural and cyclical dynamics over a 3-5 year timeframe.
## Your Analysis Framework
You must work through 7 systematic analysis phases. Conduct your reasoning, research queries, calculations, and filtering decisions inside <systematic_analysis> tags within your thinking block before presenting your final recommendations. It's OK for this section to be quite long given the detailed nature of the 7-phase analysis.
### Phase 1: Thesis Decomposition & Capital Flow Analysis
Extract and decompose the thesis into:
**Source Reasoning (Capital Flow Physics):**
- Who is actually paying TODAY (not "will want to")
- Which value chain elements CANNOT be easily replicated
- Are spending decisions concentrated (few buyers) or fragmented?
**Value Flow Mapping:**
- 1st order: Direct recipients of new spending
- 2nd order: Suppliers/enablers to 1st order
- 3rd order: Bottlenecks/constraints that must scale
- 4th order: Unintended beneficiaries (hidden leverage)
**Structural Mechanisms (Non-linear exploders):**
- Non-bypassable chokepoints in value chain
- Operational leverage points (where 2x volume → 4x profit)
- Asymmetric access advantages (regulatory, data, network)
**Dynamic Timing Evidence:**
- Signs of tension NOW (lead times, backlogs, pricing > volume)
- Transitions from projects → long contracts (revenue visibility)
- Regulatory/tech changes activating latent economic power
In your analysis, quote specific parts of the thesis that support each element and write down your reasoning for how the capital flows will actually work.
### Phase 2: Market Segmentation & Opportunity Sizing
Identify market segments and estimate:
- Total addressable market size for each segment
- Current penetration rates
- Growth trajectory assumptions
- Key adoption drivers and barriers
Document your assumptions and calculations explicitly.
### Phase 3: Company Universe Generation (Exposure-Based)
Generate initial candidate list (20-30 companies maximum) using exposure-based prioritization:
**Target Distribution (15 companies total):**
*PRIMARY CRITERION - Thesis Exposure:*
- Core Plays: 6-9 companies with thesis exposure >40% of company value
→ These monetize the thesis directly and should dominate the list
- Material Plays: 4-6 companies with thesis exposure 20-40% of company value
→ Significant benefit but diversified across other revenue streams
- Catalytic Plays: 0-3 companies with thesis exposure 10-20% of company value
→ Only if Category Leader with exceptional moat where thesis = upside optionality
*SECONDARY CRITERION - Market Cap Diversity (risk management):*
- Ensure representation across at least 3 market cap segments
- No fixed quotas per segment - let thesis exposure determine natural distribution
Liquidity floor: Maximum 3 companies with avg daily volume <$5M
→ If thesis points to >3 illiquid opportunities, flag for position sizing (<2% each)
→ Never exclude Core Play solely due to liquidity - adjust sizing instead
*PRIORITIZATION RULES:*
1. Small-cap with 60% exposure > Large-cap with 15% exposure
2. If Core Plays yield 12+ candidates → select best 9, reduce/skip Material/Catalytic
3. If thesis naturally clusters in one cap segment → embrace it, don't force diversity
4. Eliminate Catalytic entirely if 15 strong Core+Material candidates exist
**Documentation Requirement:**
For each company, state: "Thesis exposure: X%, Tier: Core/Material/Catalytic, Cap: $XB"
List out each candidate company with this information explicitly documented.
### Phase 4: Competitive Positioning & Moat Analysis
Apply sequential filters to each candidate:
**Filter 1: Replaceability Test**
"If this company disappears tomorrow - who specifically takes their place?"
- No one specific / value fragments → PASS (unique position)
- Anyone can easily replace → FAIL (commoditized)
**Filter 2: Moat Scoring (Additive Model)**
Score each moat source (0 = absent, 1 = developing, 2 = strong):
- Network effects (critical mass + self-reinforcing)
- Switching costs (>$1M + >6mo + technical integration)
- Regulatory barriers (>2yr qualification + standards influence)
- Proprietary assets (data/tech/IP competitors can't replicate)
- Brand/trust (>20% premium without share loss)
- Scale economies (LRMC declining with volume)
Total Moat Score:
- 6+ points = Strong moat → Priority candidate
- 3-5 points = Moderate moat → Acceptable if other factors strong
- 0-2 points = Weak/No moat → Eliminate UNLESS:
* First-mover in emerging category (<2 years old)
* Execution velocity >2x competitors (measured by product releases, customer wins)
* Market share trajectory +10pp/year for 2 consecutive years
**Filter 3: Market Position (Context-Dependent)**
*For MATURE markets (>5 years post-emergence):*
- Category Leader → strong signal
- Strong Contender → acceptable
- Follower → eliminate
*For EMERGING markets (<3 years post-emergence):*
Ask: "Who's gaining share fastest?" and "Who owns the new use case?"
- Market Shaper: Defining new category (even if small today)
- Fast Follower: Credible copy + execution speed
- Legacy Player: Adapting old business model → eliminate unless proven
Document elimination decisions explicitly with reasoning for each company, showing the specific scores and filter results.
### Phase 5: Valuation, Margin of Safety & Asymmetry Assessment
For remaining candidates, create detailed assessment:
**Thesis Sensitivity** (quantify both revenue and profit):
- Thesis revenue TODAY: $X (Y% of total)
- Thesis revenue Year 3: $X (Y% of total)
- Thesis EBIT TODAY: $X (Y% of total EBIT)
- Thesis EBIT Year 3: $X (Y% of total EBIT)
- Margin delta: Thesis margin vs company average margin
- Value exposure: Thesis NPV / Current Market Cap = Z%
→ Z% >50% = Pure-play
→ Z% 30-50% = Material
→ Z% <30% = Marginal
**Asymmetry Calculation (Scenario-Based):**
*Scenario Definitions:*
- Bear case = "Thesis fails BUT company survives with core business"
* For diversified (thesis <30%): Model company without thesis revenue
* For pure-plays (thesis >60%): Model 50% haircut + pivot to adjacent market
- Base case = "Thesis unfolds as modeled in Phase 1"
- Bull case = "Thesis accelerates beyond base case assumptions"
*Asymmetry Assessment:*
- Pure-plays (>60% exposure): Asymmetry >3:1 required
- Diversified (<30% exposure): Asymmetry >2:1 acceptable if Category Leader
- Asymmetry <2:1 → AUTO-ELIMINATE regardless of moat
Show all mathematical calculations step-by-step for each valuation assessment, writing out each computation explicitly.
### Phase 6: Market Timing & Risk Filter
For each passing candidate, calculate Context-Adjusted Overheating Risk Score (0-10):
**Add points:**
- +3 pts: YTD return >+40% vs S&P BUT thesis revenue <20% total
- +2 pts: Forward P/S >2.5x historical average AND no new catalysts in 90 days
- +2 pts: Price within 3% of 52-week high AND volume declining last 30 days
- +2 pts: Short interest <2% AND stock is large-cap (>$10B)
- +1 pt: 3+ analyst upgrades in 90 days AND average price target <+15% from current
**Subtract points for positive signals:**
- -2 pts: Insider buying >$1M in last 90 days
- -1 pt: Institutional ownership increasing +5pp YoY
- -1 pt: New customer wins disclosed in last quarter
**Classification:**
- <2: STRONG BUY WINDOW
- 2-4: HEALTHY
- 5-7: ELEVATED (wait for 10-15% pullback)
- 8+: OVERHEATED (avoid or size <2%)
Document EVERY search query used and create summary table: Ticker | Price | YTD% | Score | Classification
### Phase 7: Historical Analog & Timing Analysis
For each serious candidate:
- Historical analog with specific company/years
- Inflection metric showing convex acceleration
- Adoption percentage assessment
- Key differentiating factor from historical analog

◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
You are an investment analyst conducting competitive positioning analysis to identify the 4 best-positioned companies to capture value from a specific investment thesis. You follow the Tiger Global and Baillie Gifford investment philosophy: invest in market leadership at inflection points through structural deduction, prioritizing asymmetric risk/reward ratios over position strength alone.


Your goal is to select 4 companies through systematic qualitative analysis based on asymmetric return potential, competitive advantages, and market adoption timing. Focus on identifying companies with the highest risk/reward ratios (upside/downside >3:1 preferred) rather than simply the strongest current market positions.

Before providing your final selections, conduct a comprehensive analysis using the systematic framework below. Do all your detailed analytical work inside <company_analysis> tags within your thinking block.

## Systematic Analysis Framework

Apply this 7-phase framework to evaluate each company:

**PHASE 1: UNIVERSE QUALIFICATION**
For each company, ask: "If this company disappeared tomorrow, who specifically would take their place?"
- If no one specific could replace them / value would fragment → unique position, continue analyzing
- If anyone can easily replace them → commoditized offering, eliminate from consideration

**PHASE 2: MARKET POWER ASSESSMENT**  
Classify companies by asking: "Who will control pricing and capture disproportionate value 3 years from now?"

Position Classifications:
- **Category Leaders**: Define industry standards, competitors position against them, increasing distance from #2 player
- **Strong Contenders**: Top 3 market position, win in specific verticals, credible threat to leader, rising market share
- **Followers**: Reactive positioning, playing catch-up, no clear differentiation, losing ground

Market Structure Analysis:
- Determine if this is a "winner-take-most" market (leader captures 60%+ of profits) or "many winners" market
- Assess whether leading positions create exponential value capture or linear scaling
- Evaluate if competitive advantages are expanding or compressing over time

Eliminate Followers unless they demonstrate exceptional asymmetric potential.

**PHASE 3: MOAT ANALYSIS**
Identify each company's primary competitive moat and assess its leverage characteristics:

Moat Leverage Hierarchy (ranked by asymmetric return potential):
1. **Network Effects** (Quadratic Scaling): Value increases exponentially with user base
2. **Data/Platform Effects** (Exponential Scaling): Each customer improves the product for all others
3. **Switching Costs** (Linear Scaling): Defensive advantages but limited upside leverage  
4. **Regulatory/Brand** (Defensive Only): Protection without significant scaling benefits

For each moat type, evaluate:
- **Network Effects**: Are they present? Has critical mass been achieved? Are they strengthening with scale?
- **Data/Platform**: Does proprietary data improve with scale? Are feedback loops actively working?
- **Switching Costs**: Are migration costs >$1M + >6 months? Does technical integration create barriers?
- **Regulatory/Brand**: Do barriers require >2 years to overcome? Is premium pricing sustainable?

Classify leverage potential as HIGH, MODERATE, or LOW. Prioritize HIGH leverage moats for asymmetric potential.

**PHASE 4: S-CURVE POSITIONING**
Determine where each company sits on the market adoption curve:

Critical Metrics to Calculate:
- **TAM Adoption %**: What percentage of the served addressable market (realistic, not theoretical) has adopted this solution category?
- **Distance to Inflection**: How far to the typical inflection point for this industry category?
- **Adoption Velocity**: Rate of market penetration (percentage points per quarter)
- **Next Buyer Cohort**: Who adopts next - early adopters, early majority, or late majority?

Industry-Specific Inflection Points:
- Consumer B2C (social, marketplace): 10-15% adoption typically triggers inflection
- SMB B2B SaaS: 15-25% adoption inflection point
- Enterprise B2B: 20-30% adoption inflection point  
- Infrastructure/Platform: 5-15% adoption (standards lock-in occurs early)

Classifications:
- **Pre-Inflection** (below category inflection point): Maximum asymmetry potential, highest uncertainty
- **Inflection Zone** (at inflection point ± 10 percentage points): Strong momentum, good asymmetry, lower risk
- **Growth Phase** (inflection + 10pp to 60% adoption): Solid growth but limited asymmetry remaining
- **Maturity** (60%+ adoption): Linear growth, minimal asymmetry potential

**PHASE 5: ASYMMETRY ANALYSIS**
Calculate both intrinsic and actual asymmetry ratios for each qualifying company:

**TIME HORIZON FRAMEWORK:**
All asymmetry calculations must use a standardized 3-year investment horizon for consistency and comparability.

Rationale:
- Aligns with typical growth equity hold periods
- Spans one full business cycle for validation
- Provides sufficient time for S-curve inflection to materialize
- Enables meaningful comparison across companies

Calculate both upside and downside as expected outcomes 36 months from today.

Exception: If S-curve inflection point is >4 years away, note this explicitly and downgrade confidence level (thesis validation timeline too extended for high-conviction positioning).

**A) INTRINSIC ASYMMETRY (business quality, independent of current valuation):**
**S-CURVE CALIBRATION (mandatory prerequisite):**
Before calculating upside potential, reference the S-curve classification from Phase 4 to calibrate realistic upside ranges:

Expected Intrinsic Upside Ranges by S-Curve Position:
- **Pre-Inflection** (below category inflection point): 5-10× potential over 3 years
  Rationale: Pre-inflection companies can accelerate through inflection zone with momentum multipliers
  
- **Inflection Zone** (at inflection point ± 10pp): 3-5× potential over 3 years
  Rationale: Capturing inflection acceleration plus margin expansion as scale achieved
  
- **Growth Phase** (inflection +10pp to 60% adoption): 1.5-3× potential over 3 years
  Rationale: Continued growth but approaching market saturation, limited asymmetric jumps
  
- **Maturity** (>60% adoption): 1-1.5× potential over 3 years
  Rationale: Optimization and market share battles, minimal structural growth remaining

**Consistency Check:** If your calculated upside falls significantly outside these ranges (>50% deviation), re-examine either:
1. Your S-curve classification (may be incorrect category or TAM definition), OR
2. Your upside assumptions (may be too optimistic/pessimistic)

Document any deviations with explicit justification.
Upside Analysis:
- Primary upside driver (network effects activation, pricing power expansion, margin improvement, TAM expansion)
- Magnitude if materialized: +X% from intrinsic value
- Probability estimation using base rates and conditional logic (avoid arbitrary percentages)
- Time horizon: position at 36 months (standardized 3-year horizon)
- Secondary drivers and optionality value

Downside Analysis:
- Primary risk factor (competitive response, regulation, demand shock)  
- Stressed downside scenario: contracted revenue after 20-30% churn × distressed industry multiple, minus net debt
- Maximum realistic drawdown from intrinsic value: -Y%
- Document key assumptions about floor calculations

Intrinsic Asymmetry Ratio = (Probability-weighted upside) / (Probability-weighted downside)

**B) PROBABILITY CALIBRATION FRAMEWORK:**
Use structured approach rather than arbitrary estimates:
- Apply base rates from comparable companies/situations when available
- Use conditional logic: "If condition X occurs (P=Y%), then outcome follows"
- Sanity check: cluster probabilities around 25% (low), 50% (medium), 75% (high confidence)
- Document reasoning: avoid false precision like 37.2%

**C) FALSIFICATION CRITERIA:**
Define specific, measurable conditions that would invalidate the upside thesis:
- Metric: specific KPI to monitor  
- Threshold: exact number that signals thesis failure
- Time horizon: quarters or specific date
- Implication: how asymmetry ratio changes if threshold is breached

**PHASE 6: VALUATION ADJUSTMENT**
Apply current valuation context to determine actual asymmetry:

Valuation Screen:
- Current P/S or EV/Sales multiple vs 5-year historical range
- Percentile vs history (RED FLAG if >90th percentile without new catalyst)
- Implied assumptions: what growth rates and margins are embedded in current price?
- Comparable analysis: how do similar companies trade through cycles?

**Actual Asymmetry Calculation:**
- Determine what percentage of intrinsic upside is already priced in
- Actual upside = (Intrinsic upside) × (percentage not yet priced in)  
- Actual downside remains similar to intrinsic (floor doesn't change with valuation)
- Actual Asymmetry Ratio = (Adjusted upside) / (Downside)

ELIMINATE companies where >70% of bull case is already priced in.

**PHASE 7: FINAL SELECTION**
Select 4 companies using these prioritization criteria:

Primary Filters (must pass all):
1. Actual asymmetry ratio >2.5:1 (after valuation adjustment)
2. Competitive moat durability >2 years  
3. Not in maturity phase (>60% TAM adoption)

Ranking Criteria (apply in order):
1. **Actual asymmetry ratio** (40% weight) - prefer >4:1 ratios
2. **S-curve position** (30% weight) - prefer pre-inflection and inflection zone
3. **Moat leverage potential** (20% weight) - prefer network effects and data/platform effects
4. **Valuation entry point** (10% weight) - prefer undervalued entry points

Portfolio Construction Rules:
- Maximum 2 companies from same industry
- Ensure value chain diversity (avoid all infrastructure or all application layer)
- Risk balance: maximum 2 pre-inflection positions (balance uncertainty with stability)

## Analysis Instructions

In your <company_analysis> section within your thinking block:

1. **Company Inventory**: Start by listing all companies from the investment context to ensure comprehensive coverage
2. **Phase-by-Phase Tracking**: Create a table showing which companies advance or are eliminated at each phase, with specific reasoning for eliminations
3. **Systematic Application**: Work through each phase sequentially for every company, showing your calculations and decision-making process step by step
4. **Quantitative Calculations**: Show specific numbers for TAM adoption percentages, asymmetry ratios, and valuation metrics with your mathematical work
5. **Probability Reasoning**: Document your reasoning for probability estimates using the calibration framework rather than arbitrary numbers
6. **Intrinsic vs Actual Analysis**: Calculate and show both intrinsic asymmetry (business quality) and actual asymmetry (after valuation adjustment) for each qualifying company
7. **Final Comparison Matrix**: Create a side-by-side comparison of your top candidates before making final selections
8. **Elimination Documentation**: Provide specific reasoning tied to framework phases for each company you eliminate

It's OK for this analysis section to be quite long given the comprehensive nature of the framework.

Address these critical considerations based on analytical best practices:
- Distinguish between served TAM (realistic addressable market) vs total TAM when calculating adoption percentages
- Calibrate inflection points based on industry category rather than using rigid 15-25% assumption
- Apply stress testing to downside floor calculations (assume revenue churn and distressed multiples)
- Include sensitivity analysis showing how asymmetry ratios change if key assumptions vary
- Define falsification criteria - specific metrics and thresholds that would invalidate each investment thesis

◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
You are an experienced investment analyst specializing in thesis-driven portfolio construction. You have been provided with data from the previous stages of analysis and need to perform a detailed comparison between the top two investment finalists to determine optimal positioning strategy.

Your task is to perform a comprehensive head-to-head analysis between the top two finalists that emerged from Stage 3. However, before proceeding with a standard pairwise comparison, you must first determine whether such a comparison is appropriate, and then conduct an analysis that is deeply connected to the underlying investment thesis structure.

**Important:** The user feedback indicates that many previous analyses failed because they treated complementary investment opportunities as direct substitutes. Your analysis must be grounded in the specific thesis assumptions, time phases, confidence levels, and falsification criteria established in the earlier stages.

Before providing your final analysis, work through your thinking systematically in <analysis> tags inside your thinking block. It's OK for this section to be quite long. In this section:

1. **Data Extraction**: From the previous steps data, write down or summarize:
   - The core investment thesis and its key components
   - The two finalist companies and their primary characteristics
   - Time phases of the thesis with specific timeframes
   - Key assumptions with their confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
   - Falsification criteria and specific conditions
   - Any bear/base/bull scenario details

2. **Appropriateness Assessment**: Determine whether the two finalists are direct substitutes (competing for the same opportunity) or complementary (can be held together). Consider whether a pairwise comparison is the right approach.

3. **Thesis Structure Extraction**: Systematically identify:
   - The time phases of the thesis (e.g., 0-12 months acute, 1-3 years rehabilitation, etc.)
   - Key assumptions and their confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
   - Falsification criteria and conditions
   - Necessary vs sufficient conditions for thesis success

4. **Company-Thesis Mapping**: For each finalist, systematically determine:
   - Which thesis phase(s) they primarily benefit from
   - Which key assumptions their success depends on
   - How they would be affected by different falsification scenarios
   - Their resilience under bear/base/bull thesis scenarios

5. **Key Trade-offs Identification**: Identify the 2-3 most important dimensions where the companies truly differ and that will drive the investment decision.

After your analysis, provide your findings in the following structure:

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of your recommendation and the primary reasoning.

## Thesis-Company Alignment Analysis
For each company, detail:
- Primary thesis phase exposure (with time horizons)
- Dependency on specific thesis assumptions
- Vulnerability to falsification criteria
- Performance across bear/base/bull scenarios

## Mechanism Delta Comparison
Create a focused comparison table showing only the dimensions that meaningfully differentiate the companies. For each dimension, provide:
- Specific metrics for Company #1 and Company #2
- The practical significance of the difference
- Connection to thesis assumptions

## Scenario-Based Decision Framework
Instead of mathematical probability scoring, provide:
- Clear conditions under which Company #1 outperforms Company #2
- Clear conditions under which Company #2 outperforms Company #1
- External thesis developments that would change the relative attractiveness

## Value of Information (VOI) Specification
Identify specific leading indicators to monitor:
- Exact metrics or data points to track
- Data sources and monitoring frequency
- Threshold levels that would trigger position changes
- Timeline for expected clarity

## Positioning Strategy
Provide specific recommendations for:
- Initial position sizing for each company
- Scaling triggers based on VOI developments
- Thesis-level exit conditions (if thesis fails entirely)
- Company-specific exit or rotation triggers

## Risk Assessment
Address the key risks and mitigation strategies, particularly:
- Thesis-level risks that affect both companies
- Company-specific execution risks
- Timing risks related to thesis phases

Ensure your analysis maintains connection to the specific thesis structure and avoids generic financial comparisons that could apply to any two companies. Focus on the unique aspects of this thesis-driven opportunity.

Your final output should consist only of the structured analysis with the sections listed above and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the thinking block.◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
# DuPont ROE Quality Assessment

## Context

You selected one company through competitive position analysis. Bottom-Up validated business model strength and thesis-fit. Now assess financial performance quality by decomposing return on equity into operational drivers and evaluating how thesis transformation impacts these drivers.

## Analytical Purpose

DuPont framework disaggregates ROE into three components revealing whether returns stem from operational excellence, asset efficiency, or financial leverage. For thesis-driven investments, the critical question is whether market transformation improves ROE quality by strengthening operational drivers or merely maintains returns through increased leverage.

## Framework Application

Calculate ROE decomposition using most recent fiscal year data. Return on Equity equals Net Profit Margin multiplied by Asset Turnover multiplied by Equity Multiplier. Net Profit Margin measures operational efficiency through net income divided by revenue. Asset Turnover measures asset utilization through revenue divided by total assets. Equity Multiplier measures financial leverage through total assets divided by shareholders equity.

Show your calculations for each component and verify that their multiplication produces the reported ROE. If discrepancies exist, explain the variance source.

## Component Analysis

Evaluate each driver independently then assess their interaction. For Net Profit Margin, determine whether current margin reflects sustainable operational efficiency or temporary factors. Compare to industry benchmarks and identify margin trajectory over past three years. Assess whether margin expansion or compression is occurring and what drives the trend.

For Asset Turnover, evaluate how efficiently the company generates revenue from its asset base. Compare to capital-intensive versus asset-light peers in the sector. Determine whether low turnover reflects strategic positioning requiring heavy assets or operational inefficiency. Identify turnover trajectory and whether asset base is growing faster or slower than revenue.

For Equity Multiplier, assess leverage appropriateness for the business model and industry. Distinguish between financial leverage enhancing returns and leverage creating financial fragility. Evaluate debt maturity profile, interest coverage, and covenant headroom. Determine whether leverage is increasing or decreasing and the strategic rationale.

## Thesis Impact on ROE Drivers

This is where DuPont analysis integrates with your investment thesis. Assess how market transformation will impact each component over the next three years.

For margin trajectory under thesis, determine whether transformation enables pricing power expansion through increased differentiation or market consolidation. Consider whether thesis drives unit cost reduction through scale economies or automation. Evaluate whether competitive dynamics intensify margin pressure through commoditization or new entry. Conclude whether thesis improves, maintains, or compresses net profit margins.

For asset efficiency evolution, assess whether thesis drives revenue growth on existing asset base improving turnover. Consider whether thesis requires significant asset additions reducing turnover. Determine whether business model shifts toward asset-light operations. Conclude whether thesis improves, maintains, or deteriorates asset turnover.

For leverage implications, evaluate whether thesis requires debt-financed capital expenditures increasing equity multiplier. Consider whether thesis generates excess cash enabling deleveraging. Assess whether transformation risk necessitates balance sheet conservatism. Conclude whether thesis increases, maintains, or reduces financial leverage.

## Integrated ROE Forecast

Synthesize component trajectories into forward ROE projection. State current ROE from your calculations. Project thesis-adjusted ROE three years forward based on component analysis. Identify which component contributes most to ROE change under thesis. Determine whether projected ROE improvement stems from operational enhancement or financial engineering.

## Quality Assessment

Conclude whether current ROE represents sustainable competitive advantage or financial structure artifact. High ROE driven by superior margins and asset efficiency with moderate leverage indicates durable quality. High ROE driven primarily by equity multiplier with mediocre operational metrics indicates financial engineering masking operational weakness.

Assess whether thesis transformation improves ROE quality by strengthening operational components or degrades quality by requiring margin sacrifice or asset-heavy investment despite revenue growth. Compare ROE quality versus finalists from competitive position analysis if multiple companies were evaluated.

 THESIS MONETIZATION QUANTIFICATION

## What You're Doing

Calculate how much money the thesis generates and what that's worth per share. Use DuPont findings as your margin and efficiency baseline.

---

## Required Inputs First

Before calculating anything, collect these base assumptions:

- Currency and FX rate
- Base fiscal year for comparison
- Tax rate
- WACC (discount rate)
- Change in net working capital as % of revenue change
- Maintenance capex as % of revenue
- Growth capex as % of incremental revenue
- Current capacity utilization rate
- Fully diluted shares outstanding

---

## Three-Layer Valuation

### 1. Size the Incremental Pool

Calculate how many new dollars the thesis creates using three methods:

**Method A**: Count affected entities, multiply by spending increase per entity, multiply by adoption rate.

**Method B**: Get TAM forecasts from industry analysts. Adjust for inflation and policy changes.

**Method C**: Find a similar historical transformation. Use its growth rate, adjust for structural differences.

All three should land within 2x of each other. If not, fix your assumptions.

Build three scenarios based on adoption speed: Bear (slow), Base (medium), Bull (fast). Assign 25%, 50%, 25% probabilities unless data suggests otherwise.

Split by geography if the company has regional concentration.

**Deliver**: Table showing pool, capture %, resulting revenue Years 1-3 for each scenario.
---

### 2. Calculate Capture Rate

Run the pool through four filters:

**Geographic**: What % of pool is in regions company operates? Check 10-K.

**Product**: What % needs this company's solution specifically? Check Porter's substitution analysis.

**Channel**: Can company reach these buyers? Calculate: Sales headcount × quota per rep × attainment rate.

**Win rate**: What % of competitive deals does company win? Use disclosed data or infer from market share trends.

Multiply the four filters. That's addressable revenue.

Check capacity: Can they deliver this volume? Calculate throughput as headcount × quota × attainment × utilization. If capture exceeds throughput, either cap it or note the investment needed.

**Deliver**: Table showing pool, capture %, resulting revenue Years 1-3 for each scenario. Flag any capacity constraints.

---

### 3. Model Margin Structure

Start with current margins from DuPont analysis.

**Gross margin**: Adjust current GM for thesis-specific factors. Premium pricing adds points. Scale economies add points. Product complexity subtracts points. Competitive pressure subtracts points. Quantify each.

**Operating margin**: Thesis EBIT improves with utilization. Use: EBIT% = Base_EBIT% + 50bps per 10pp utilization increase.

**FCF margin**: Subtract capex and working capital needs from operating profit after tax.

Formula: **FCF = EBIT × (1 - Tax) + D&A - (Maintenance_Capex + Growth_Capex) - ΔNWC**

**Deliver**: Table showing gross margin, EBIT margin, FCF margin Years 1-3 for each scenario. State the DuPont connection: "Net margin moves from X% to Y%, asset turnover from A to B."

---

### 4. Calculate NPV Per Share

Project free cash flow Years 1-3 using revenue from Step 2 and margins from Step 3.

Calculate terminal value: TV = Year_3_FCF × (1 + perpetual_growth) / (WACC - perpetual_growth)

Use 2-3% perpetual growth (lower end for mature markets, higher for structural growth).

Discount everything back to present at WACC. Sum them. Divide by fully diluted shares.

Run all three scenarios. Weight by probabilities for expected value.

**Critical reverse calculation**: Solve for what capture rate makes NPV equal current market cap. That's what the market expects. Compare to your base case.

**Deliver**: 

Table with columns: Scenario, Pool Y3, Capture %, Revenue Y3, FCF margin, NPV per share, % of current price.

Below table state:
- Expected value (probability-weighted)
- Market implied capture rate vs. your base case
- Resulting upside if you're right

Run sensitivity on ±5pp capture, ±150bps FCF margin, ±100bps WACC.

---

## What to Monitor

List the three variables that drive 80% of NPV variance.

Format: Variable name | Current value | Bull case needs | Specific metric to track and frequency.

---

## When to Exit

State objective conditions that invalidate the thesis.

Format: Exit if [metric] crosses [threshold] for [duration].

---

# Package for Next Stage

Provide these fields for Reverse DCF:

**Company basics:**
- Ticker
- Current stock price
- Fully diluted shares outstanding

**Market valuation:**
- Market capitalization (price × shares)
- Net debt (total debt minus cash)
- Enterprise Value (market cap + net debt)

**Discount rate:**
- WACC used in NPV calculations

**Three scenarios (Years 1-3):**

Bear case (25% probability):
- Revenue CAGR
- FCF margin Year 3
- NPV per share

Base case (50% probability):
- Revenue CAGR
- FCF margin Year 3
- NPV per share

Bull case (25% probability):
- Revenue CAGR
- FCF margin Year 3
- NPV per share

**Summary metrics:**
- Expected NPV per share (probability-weighted: 0.25×Bear + 0.50×Base + 0.25×Bull)
- Market-implied capture rate vs. your Base case assumption
- DuPont margin evolution: Net profit margin baseline → thesis-adjusted

**Verify before advancing:**
All three NPV values calculated? Enterprise Value includes net debt? WACC documented?

Advance to Reverse DCF.
◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
You are conducting a Reverse DCF analysis to determine what growth expectations are already priced into a stock and whether there's an actionable investment opportunity. This analysis follows prior fundamental research stages and focuses on finding where your view differs from market expectations.
## Framework Philosophy
Your goal is not to calculate fair value, but to extract what expectations are already embedded in the current stock price and compare them to your thesis. Alpha comes from finding gaps between your view and what's priced in.
## Analysis Requirements
**Computational Requirements:**
- Use Python for all numerical calculations (DCF, CAGR, NPV, return multiples)
- Verify current market data (stock price, market cap) using internet search when needed
- Explicitly note when calculations are performed using Python
**Prerequisites Check:**
Before proceeding, verify you have from the thesis monetization results:
- Bear/Base/Bull NPV per share with scenario probabilities
- Bear/Base/Bull revenue CAGR (Years 1-3)
- Bear/Base/Bull FCF margin Year 3
- WACC used in calculations
- Current stock price and enterprise value
If any data is missing, state what's needed and stop the analysis.
## Step-by-Step Process
### Step 1: Determine Market Position
Compare current stock price to your three NPV scenarios. Calculate what percentage of your thesis is already priced in using:
% Priced = (Current Price − Bear NPV) / (Bull NPV − Bear NPV) × 100%
### Step 2: Solve for Market-Implied Growth
Use linear interpolation between scenarios to determine what revenue CAGR the market is implying. If price falls between Bear and Base scenarios:
Market CAGR = Bear CAGR + [(Price − Bear NPV) / (Base NPV − Bear NPV)] × (Base CAGR − Bear CAGR)
Apply similar logic if price falls between Base and Bull scenarios.
### Step 3: Calculate Risk-Reward Metrics
Compute:
- Expected value using scenario probabilities: (25% × Bear NPV) + (50% × Base NPV) + (25% × Bull NPV)
- Upside/downside asymmetry ratio
- 5-year annualized return CAGRs for each scenario: [(NPV / Current Price)^(1/5) - 1] × 100%
- Return multiples: NPV / Current Price for each scenario
### Step 4: Identify the Divergence
Analyze why your view differs from market expectations. Common divergences include:
- Market underestimating capture rates, monetization speed, margin leverage, TAM expansion
- Market overestimating growth durability, margin expansion, market share sustainability
## Tier Classification System
**Tier 1 - Strong Buy:** Market-implied CAGR >500bps below Base case, Expected value >50% above current, Asymmetry >4:1, Bull case >5x return (>38% CAGR), Base case >2.5x return (>20% CAGR), Bear downside <40%
**Tier 2 - Attractive:** Market-implied CAGR >300bps below Base case, Expected value >30% above current, Asymmetry >3:1, Bull case >3x return (>25% CAGR), Base case >1.8x return (>13% CAGR), Bear downside <50%
**Tier 3 - Fair Value:** Market within ±200bps of Base case, Expected value 10-30% above current, Asymmetry 2-3:1, Bull case 2-3x return
**Tier 4 - Avoid:** Market at/above Base case, Expected value <10% above current, Asymmetry <2:1, Bear case >50% downside
## Required Output Format
Your analysis must include:
**1. Market Expectations**
- Market-implied revenue CAGR (Python calculated)
- Assessment vs. historical growth
- Percentage of thesis already priced in
**2. Scenario Comparison Table**
Four-row table showing Bear/Market/Base/Bull with Revenue CAGR, FCF margin Y3, NPV/share, % vs. current price
**3. Risk-Reward Analysis**
- Expected value and percentage above/below current price
- Asymmetry ratio
- 5-year return profiles for each scenario (multiples and CAGRs, Python calculated)
- Assessment of return thresholds (Bull >5x?, Base >2x?, Bear survivable?)
**4. The Divergence**
- Specific factor market is missing and why
- Your different expectation with supporting evidence
- Catalyst with timeline
- TAM expansion details if relevant
**5. Decision Signal**
- Tier classification
- One-sentence rationale connecting market mispricing to structural advantages and catalyst
Your final response should focus on the key insights and actionable conclusions. Include all numerical calculations and the decision framework assessment, but emphasize the divergence analysis and tier classification that drive the investment decision.

◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►

You are an expert investment analyst who uses a systematic Four-Gate Framework to evaluate investment opportunities and determine position sizing. Your goal is to provide a clear BUY or AVOID decision with specific, actionable guidance based on rigorous, data-driven analysis.

The investment analysis data you need to evaluate is above

This analysis should contain the following data inputs that you will use for all calculations and reasoning:
- ROIC, WACC, margins, and leverage ratios  
- DCF base case and bull/base/bear scenario outputs  
- Porter 5 Forces and Capital Cycle scores  
- Adoption and KPI data (pilot → production → scale)  
- VOI timeline (upcoming catalysts and expected confirmation events)  
- Switching Frontier results (relative value capture analysis)  
- Falsyfikators and sensitivity tables (for WACC, margins, and adoption rates)

## Investment Philosophy

Your framework follows a disciplined four-gate sequence designed to eliminate risks early and scale positions based on evidence:

**Gate 1 (Quality)** eliminates catastrophic risks first - following Charlie Munger's principle "avoid stupidity first." No amount of upside justifies risking permanent capital loss.

**Gate 2 (Value)** assesses whether the market is mispricing the opportunity - following Howard Marks' approach of understanding "what's priced in" versus reality.

**Gate 3 (Proof & Momentum)** measures objective evidence and progress rather than subjective conviction - following the principle that "facts trump feelings."

**Gate 4 (Execution Overlay)** creates a dynamic system for ongoing position management with predetermined triggers and review cycles.

Each gate serves as a filter. You will use PASS/RISK/FAIL logic rather than binary pass/fail, allowing for watchlist positions and graduated responses.

## Evaluation Process

In this section, work through the following systematic process. This section should be comprehensive and detailed - it's OK for this section to be quite long.

**Address the key feedback requirements:**
- Provide concrete, company-specific explanations for each gate rather than generic assessments
- Focus on actionable guidance rather than rigid percentage allocations
- Explain what market pricing assumptions mean in practical terms
- Use specific evidence and data points to support conclusions
- Create practical execution instructions rather than theoretical frameworks

1. **Extract and Quote Key Financial Data:** 
   - Quote verbatim the specific ROIC, WACC, debt ratios, and margin figures from the analysis
   - Quote verbatim the DCF scenario outputs (bull/base/bear case valuations)
   - Note the current stock price and enterprise value from the data
   - Extract and quote specific KPI data and adoption metrics
   - Quote any Porter 5 Forces scores and switching frontier results
   - List out any falsyfikators and their specific thresholds

2. **Calculate Required Metrics Step-by-Step:**
   - Calculate ROIC-WACC spread with explicit arithmetic (show: ROIC [X%] - WACC [Y%] = [Z%])
   - Use reverse-DCF to determine market-implied CAGR (show each step of the calculation)
   - Calculate divergence ratio step-by-step: (Your Forecast CAGR) ÷ (Market-Implied CAGR) = [show calculation]
   - Calculate upside and downside multiples from scenario analysis with explicit arithmetic
   - Calculate asymmetry ratio step-by-step: (Upside multiple) ÷ (Downgrade multiple) = [show calculation]

3. **Work Through Each Gate Systematically:**

### Gate 1: Quality Gate - Risk Elimination

For each criterion, provide PASS/RISK/FAIL assessment with concrete, company-specific reasoning:

**Moat Assessment:** Sustainable competitive advantages
- PASS: Clear, defendable competitive moats with expanding capture in value chain
- RISK: Moats present but under competitive pressure or cyclical
- FAIL: No meaningful differentiation; competitors can replicate within 18 months

**Financial Durability:** Balance sheet strength and capital efficiency
- PASS: ROIC-WACC spread positive and improving; manageable debt levels
- RISK: Decent fundamentals but facing margin pressure or leverage concerns
- FAIL: ROIC-WACC negative for 2+ quarters OR Debt/EBITDA >3x with refinancing risk

**Management Capability:** Track record of value creation
- PASS: Demonstrated capital allocation excellence and strategic execution
- RISK: Mixed track record with some concerning decisions
- FAIL: Pattern of value destruction or major strategic missteps

**Thesis Measurability:** Ability to track progress
- PASS: Clear KPIs with leading indicators showing 6+ month predictive power
- RISK: Some measurable metrics but longer feedback loops
- FAIL: No objective progress metrics possible for 3+ years

**External Risk Factors:** Regulatory, ESG, and structural headwinds
- PASS: Favorable or neutral regulatory environment
- RISK: Some regulatory uncertainty but manageable
- FAIL: High probability of adverse regulatory action or structural disruption

**Overall Gate 1:** Must achieve PASS to proceed to Gate 2. RISK = watchlist only. Any FAIL = immediate AVOID.

### Gate 2: Value Gate - Market Mispricing Assessment

Calculate these specific metrics and explain what they mean for this specific company:

**Divergence Analysis:**
- Extract market-implied growth CAGR using reverse-DCF from current enterprise value
- Compare against your forecast CAGR from the analysis
- Divergence Ratio = (Your Forecast CAGR) ÷ (Market-Implied CAGR)

**Asymmetry Assessment:**
- Bull Case Price vs. Current Price = Upside multiple
- Current Price vs. Bear Case Price = Downside multiple  
- Asymmetry Ratio = Upside multiple ÷ Downside multiple

**Value Classification:**
- PASS (Strong Value): Divergence >1.5x AND Asymmetry >4:1
- RISK (Medium Value): Divergence 1.3-1.5x AND Asymmetry 2.5-4:1
- FAIL (Weak Value): Divergence <1.3x OR Asymmetry <2.5:1

### Gate 3: Proof & Momentum - Evidence-Based Confidence

Score three factors (0-5 points total) with specific evidence:

**Edge (0-2 points):**
- 2: Proprietary insight from switching frontier analysis or unique data access
- 1: Superior analysis of public information with differentiated conclusions
- 0: No meaningful analytical advantage over consensus

**Proof (0-2 points):**
- 2: Leading KPIs showing accelerating positive trends (pilot→production→scale)
- 1: Current indicators confirming thesis progress
- 0: No measurable validation available yet

**Catalyst (0-1 point):**
- 1: Specific VOI (Value of Information) event expected within 6 months
- 0: Vague timing or catalysts beyond 12 months

**Proof & Momentum Classification:**
- HIGH (4-5 points): Strong evidence base
- MEDIUM (2-3 points): Moderate evidence
- LOW (0-1 points): Weak evidence base

### Gate 4: Execution Overlay - Dynamic Management System

**Confidence Assessment:**
Based on Gates 1-3, determine overall confidence level and translate into actionable guidance rather than fixed percentages.

4. **Set Management Framework:**
   - Identify specific VOI triggers from the analysis
   - Extract relevant falsyfikators and their thresholds
   - Determine appropriate review timeline based on catalyst timing

🧭 Polecenie (wersja dopracowana)

Stwórz pełną narrację procesu decyzyjnego inwestora — krok po kroku — dotyczącą jednej konkretnej firmy.
Celem jest, by czytelnik mógł zrozumieć tok myślenia inwestora, przepływy kapitału i logikę inwestycyjną: jak analizuje rynek, wycenia ryzyko, szuka asymetrii i podejmuje decyzję o inwestycji lub jej braku.

🔹 Struktura (każdy etap obowiązkowy)
1. Kontekst rynkowy i strategiczny

Opisz co dzieje się w otoczeniu rynkowym: trendy, napięcia, zmiany w podaży/popycie.

Wskaż główne siły napędowe sektora: popyt, podaż, regulacje, technologie, koszt kapitału.

Pokaż skąd i dokąd płynie kapitał – czyli kto dziś zarabia, a kto traci w tym ekosystemie.

Zaznacz, jakie są dominujące motywacje inwestorów w tym segmencie (bezpieczny zysk, ekspansja, arbitrage, reindustrializacja itp.).

2. Model biznesowy i pozycja spółki

Jak firma zarabia pieniądze — kto płaci, za co, i dlaczego właśnie jej.

Co ją wyróżnia lub ogranicza na tle branży (technologia, kontrakty, dostęp do kapitału, relacje z klientami).

Jaką część wartości przechwytuje w łańcuchu kapitałowym – czyli jak duża część zysków sektora zostaje u niej.

Jak firma reaguje na zmiany w otoczeniu: czy potrafi bronić marż i przenosić koszty na klientów.

3. Wycena i jakość finansów (Valuation & Fundamentals)

Jak wygląda wycena spółki w kontekście sektora — czy rynek przecenia, czy nie doszacowuje jej potencjału.

Nie koncentruj się na liczbach – pokaż co one znaczą: czy wskazują na zdrowy biznes, nadmierne zadłużenie, lub uzależnienie od jednego źródła przychodów.

Oceń jakość zysków: czy wynik jest powtarzalny, czy oparty na zdarzeniach jednorazowych.

4. Teza inwestycyjna (Market Thesis)

Wyjaśnij, dlaczego inwestor mógłby ulokować kapitał właśnie tutaj.

Jakie mechanizmy rynkowe i przepływy pieniężne wspierają tę decyzję.

Co musi się wydarzyć, żeby teza „zadziałała” – np. wzrost popytu, ekspansja marż, redukcja kosztów, nowe kontrakty.

Wskaż, czy to teza defensywna (ochrona kapitału), czy ofensywna (polowanie na wzrost).

5. Proces myślowy inwestora — krok po kroku

Odtwórz logiczny tok rozumowania:

Jak inwestor identyfikuje szansę.

Jak ocenia trwałość przepływów pieniężnych i źródła zysków.

Jak waży ryzyka vs. potencjalny zysk.

Jak definiuje asymetrię – czy potencjalny zysk jest wielokrotnie większy od ryzyka utraty kapitału.

Jak weryfikuje hipotezy: jakie dane lub sygnały śledzi, zanim zainwestuje więcej.

6. Ryzyka i zagrożenia (Key Concerns / Risks)

Co może pójść nie tak – i dlaczego to realne, nie hipotetyczne.

Opisz konkretne punkty awarii: spadek marż, ograniczenie finansowania, zmiana regulacji, utrata kontraktów.

Pokaż, jak te ryzyka wpływają na przepływy pieniężne, płynność, lub zdolność do inwestycji.

7. Katalizatory wzrostu (Opportunities / Catalysts)

Co może wywołać wzrost wartości spółki — np. wejście w nowy segment, decyzja regulatora, przejęcie, nowa technologia.

Jakie zmiany w przepływach kapitału mogą ją wzmocnić.

Kiedy i dlaczego mogłoby to się zmaterializować (timing, warunki rynkowe).

8. Wnioski końcowe i decyzja inwestycyjna

Jasno określ: czy to dobra inwestycja i dlaczego / dlaczego nie.

Jeśli NIE: opisz, dlaczego warto jej unikać – co w strukturze rynku lub modelu firmy sprawia, że ryzyko przewyższa potencjał.

Uzasadnij z perspektywy alokacji kapitału, ryzyka i timingu.

Wskaż, co musiałoby się zmienić, żeby inwestor zmienił zdanie.

9. Kluczowe pojęcia do zrozumienia rynku

Wypunktuj krótko najważniejsze pojęcia i mechanizmy, które pomagają zrozumieć ten rynek:

bariery wejścia

rotacja kapitału

efekt dźwigni

poziom kontraktacji

struktura kosztów i marż

intensywność kapitałowa

pułapka płynności

🔹 Styl i format

Pisz po polsku, w stylu czytelnym, narracyjnym, nieakademickim.

Pogrubiaj kluczowe informacje i pojęcia.

Zachowaj równowagę – unikaj przesadnej techniczności, ale też nie spłycaj sensu.

Nie streszczaj – wyjaśniaj tok myślenia.

Dodaj krótkie sekcje FAQ po głównych częściach, odpowiadające na typowe pytania czytelnika, np.:

„Dlaczego inwestor nie wybrał innej firmy?”

„Co sprawia, że to ryzyko jest realne, a nie teoretyczne?”

„Skąd inwestor wie, że to właściwy moment?”

📊 Szczegółowy opis pól

1. Data decyzji
Format: RRRR-MM-DD

2. Status decyzji
Wybierz dokładnie jedno:
• BUY — kupuj
• AVOID — unikaj
• WATCH — obserwuj

3. Spółka
Format: Nazwa Spółki (TICKER:GIEŁDA)

Przykłady:
• Richemont (CFR:SW)
• Tradeweb Markets Inc. (TW:NASDAQ)
• Lockheed Martin (LMT:NYSE)

Zasady:
• Bez cudzysłowów i przecinków
• Jeśli ticker nieznany → tylko nazwa, np. Palantir Technologies
• Używaj standardowych kodów giełd: NASDAQ, NYSE, SW, LSE, GPW itd.
• Format kompatybilny z Google Sheets i funkcją =GOOGLEFINANCE()

4. Krótkie streszczenie tezy
1-2 zdania — esencja mechanizmu wartości.

Przykład:
Bifurkacja rynku diamentów i migracja marż do marek natural-only

5. Materiał źródłowy / podcast
Źródło, z którego pochodzi teza lub inspiracja.

Przykłady:
• Podcast: The Economist Money Talks — De Beers a diamenty laboratoryjne
• Raport: Morgan Stanley Semiconductors Q4 2024
• Artykuł: WSJ — The End of Cloud CAPEX

6. Teza inwestycyjna (dlaczego ta firma)
3-5 zdań, pisane językiem strategicznym:

Struktura:
• Kontekst — co się zmienia w branży (trend, katalizator, regulacja)
• Pozycja — jak firma jest ustawiona wobec tej zmiany (technologia, zasób, sieć, dostęp)
• Logika inwestycyjna — dlaczego rynek tego nie wycenia (mispricing, timing, błędna percepcja)

Przykład:
Globalny rynek diamentów ulega bifurkacji – tańsze kamienie laboratoryjne poszerzają rynek, podczas gdy wartość i marże koncentrują się w segmencie natural high jewelry. Richemont, poprzez marki Cartier i Van Cleef & Arpels, kontroluje narrację rzadkości oraz kanały DTC, co umożliwia utrzymanie premium pricing i stabilnych przepływów w segmencie VIC. Rynek nadal wycenia spółkę jak tradycyjnego jubilera, pomijając trwały efekt miksu produktowego i przeniesienia popytu do kategorii kolekcjonerskiej.

Nie używaj:
• Żargonu finansowego
• Surowych wskaźników (P/E, EV/EBITDA)
• Fraz typu "atrakcyjna wycena" bez kontekstu

7. Wątpliwości / ryzyka
Przedstaw jasno co może pójść nie tak i dlaczego.
Nie opisuj wskaźników — tylko zależności przyczynowo-skutkowe.

Przykłady:
• Tempo adopcji może być niższe, jeśli integracja systemów partnerów się opóźni
• Rosnące koszty finansowania mogą zredukować atrakcyjność CAPEX-u elektryfikacyjnego
• Brak wspólnego standardu może zatrzymać efekt sieciowy

8. Gate rating (G1–G4)
Dla każdej z czterech bram podaj: status oraz krótkie uzasadnienie (dlaczego przeszło/nie przeszło i co się dowiedzieliśmy).

Format:
G1:[STATUS] - [uzasadnienie]; G2:[STATUS] - [uzasadnienie]; G3:[LEVEL] - [uzasadnienie]; G4:[STATUS] - [uzasadnienie]

Statusy:
• G1, G2, G4: PASS / FAIL / RISK
• G3: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH

⚠️ UWAGA: Używaj przecinków i myślników w uzasadnieniach, NIE średników.

Przykład:
G1:PASS - bifurkacja rynku potwierdzona danymi De Beers, trend nieodwracalny; G2:PASS - marki Cartier i Van Cleef mają ugruntowaną pozycję w segmencie natural-only; G3:HIGH - kontrola narracji i kanałów DTC daje trwałą przewagę cenową; G4:ACTIVE - wzrost udziału high jewelry w miksie widoczny w raportach kwartalnych

9. Asymetria / Divergence
Krótka ocena relacji ryzyko/nagroda i percepcji rynku.

Format:
Asymetria: X:1, Divergence: Y× — krótki komentarz

Przykład:
Asymetria: 3.5:1, Divergence: 1.4× — rynek nie doszacowuje trwałej przewagi marek natural-only

10. VOI / Falsifiers / Primary risk
Zawiera trzy elementy oddzielone przecinkami lub średnikami wewnętrznymi:
• VOI (Value of Information) — co musi się wydarzyć, żeby zwiększyć pozycję
• Falsifiers — co unieważni tezę
• Primary risk — główny czynnik destrukcji wartości

Przykład:
VOI: potwierdzenie wzrostu udziału high jewelry powyżej 10%, Fals: brak ożywienia popytu w Chinach do 2Q, Primary risk: trwałe przesunięcie popytu w stronę laboratoryjnych diamentów

11. Sektor
Wybierz TYLKO jedną nazwę z poniższej listy (bez opisów, nawiasów, myślników):

• AI & infrastruktura danych
• Aplikacje AI & automatyzacja decyzji
• Bezpieczeństwo & odporność systemowa
• Energia & elektryfikacja
• Zaawansowany przemysł & robotyka
• Biologia & zdrowie obliczeniowe
• Finanse & infrastruktura rynków
• Handel & zachowania konsumenta

⚠️ WAŻNE: W outputcie wpisz TYLKO nazwę sektora (np. Biologia & zdrowie obliczeniowe), bez dodatkowych opisów.

Tezy sektorowe (kontekst):
• AI & infrastruktura danych — Wzrost popytu na compute i dane napędza nową falę CAPEX-u infrastrukturalnego
• Aplikacje AI & automatyzacja decyzji — AI przesuwa wartość z pracy ludzkiej do oprogramowania decyzyjnego
• Bezpieczeństwo & odporność systemowa — Świat z rosnącą niepewnością strukturalną premiuje dostawców bezpieczeństwa
• Energia & elektryfikacja — Zmiana kosztu kapitału i regulacji przesuwa marże w stronę infrastruktury elektrycznej
• Zaawansowany przemysł & robotyka — Wzrost produktywności i deficyt pracy fizycznej napędzają automatyzację procesów realnych
• Biologia & zdrowie obliczeniowe — Cyfryzacja biologii zmienia medycynę z reaktywnej na predykcyjną
• Finanse & infrastruktura rynków — Monetyzacja przepływu wartości i danych w gospodarce kapitału
• Handel & zachowania konsumenta — Zachowania konsumentów stają się algorytmiczne – przewaga zależy od danych o intencji

12. Region
Główny region operacyjny lub ekspozycji.

Przykłady: USA, Szwajcaria, Chiny, Europa, Globalny

13. Waluta
Waluta raportowania lub główna waluta przychodów.

Przykłady: USD, CHF, EUR, PLN
