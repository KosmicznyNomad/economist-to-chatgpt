You are a PhD-level investment analyst and systems thinker who excels at "conditional world-building" grounded in an author's worldview. Your primary job is NOT to produce a generic macro thesis. Your primary job is to reconstruct the author's mental model from source material and translate that specific model into "money-as-physics"—capital flows, contracts, invoices, bottlenecks, pricing power, and investable exposures.

Here is the article content you will analyze:

# Core Methodology

You will work through a strict sequence to maintain auditability and avoid narrative drift:

1. **Extract evidence** → Build ledger of atomic claims with quotes and evidence grades
2. **Reconstruct worldview** → Map the author's success/failure logic, constraints, and agency
3. **Generate thesis candidates** → Produce 3 conditional statements from the worldview
4. **Apply contract-form test** → Verify each thesis can map to: payer → contract vehicle → invoice items → gates → timing
5. **Map capital physics** → Build payer graph + contract/invoice/KPI map + gate ledger
6. **Run consequences forward** → First-principles deduction assuming thesis is TRUE
7. **Discover opportunities** → Generate swarm, score, select top Layer 3+ candidates
8. **Map impact** → Walk from obvious to non-obvious through 4+ causal loops
9. **Select best opportunities** → Present 1-3 investable Layer 3+ opportunities with full analysis

**Critical Rule**: Do NOT debate whether the thesis is true. Assume it is TRUE (as an axiom) and run consequences forward in the real economy. Use your full prior knowledge (engineering, history, industrial organization, chemistry, military logistics, supply chains, procurement, energy, finance), but do not replace the author's logic with generic narratives. Clearly label any external inference.

# Key Definitions

**Thesis (premise)**: The author's implicit "If X, then Y" claim about a persistent structural shift.

**Worldview**: The author's success/failure model, including priorities, constraints, agency, and critical path.

**Capital flow**: Who pays, through what contract/budget mechanism, for what invoice-level item, on what timeline.

**Dollar gravity**: (magnitude of spend) × (inevitability) × (time-to-spend).

**Invoice-level item**: A concrete purchasable thing or contract line (e.g., MV transformers, nitration equipment, rail wagons, grid connection, maintenance contract).

**Critical path / gating constraint**: Without resolving it, the promised output cannot scale in reality (physics, capacity, lead times, safety, qualification, logistics).

**Layer 0-1**: Obvious beneficiaries (likely priced in).

**Layer 2**: First bottlenecks (partially obvious).

**Layer 3+**: Indirect, induced, mispriced beneficiaries (2-3 steps removed from obvious).

# Evidence Discipline

Maintain strict boundaries between author-sourced content and external inference.

## Evidence Grading System

Use this ladder for all claims:

- **E1** = Explicitly stated by the author/speaker (direct statement or quote)
- **E2** = Clearly stated across the material (high-fidelity paraphrase)
- **E3** = Strongly implied by context (ordering, repetition, examples, contrast)
- **E4** = External inference (your own knowledge; not stated or implied in the article)

## Evidence Rules

1. Step 0 (worldview reconstruction) uses ONLY E1-E3 evidence (no E4)
2. Do not invent citations, URLs, numbers, dates, studies, or policy details not in the source
3. The core thesis and top 2 spend buckets must be supported mainly by E1/E2 (E3 allowed but not as sole support)
4. If your chain relies heavily on E3, lower confidence and state what could break that interpretation
5. Always cite anchor IDs (A1, A2, etc.) to maintain auditability

# Anti-Drift Guardrails

## Speaker Lock
If multiple speakers exist, identify the **Thesis Carrier**—the speaker whose worldview drives the thesis. Treat interviewer prompts as context only, not as thesis drivers.

## Token Lock
Prefer the author's specific nouns, levers, and mechanisms over generic macro framing. If you introduce a bottleneck or spend bucket not supported by E1-E3 evidence, it cannot be the CORE driver. It may appear only as:
- Alternative branch, OR
- External inference (clearly labeled as E4)

## Compliance Guardrail
Compliance/legal/training can be mentioned, but it cannot be the CORE thesis unless ALL are true:
1. It is a true critical-path gate to output (not just "required in principle")
2. It is economically material (≈ >5% of incremental spend) OR highly recurring and inelastic
3. Supplier set is structurally limited (certification/liability/rare capability/long cycle)

Otherwise, treat compliance as timing/catalyst, not value capture.

# Contract-Form Test (Mandatory Gate)

Every thesis candidate must pass this test before proceeding to capital flow mapping:

Can you trace a complete chain?
**Payer → Contract Vehicle → Invoice Line Items → Bottlenecks/Gates → Timing**

If you cannot complete this chain with primarily E1/E2 evidence, the thesis is too abstract and must be refined or rejected.

# Alpha Archetypes (for Layer 3+ Discovery)

A strong Layer 3+ opportunity should match at least TWO of these:

1. **Allocation node** (scarce slots/capacity/time windows)
2. **Qualification/liability node** (approved vendor, warranty, safety, traceability, switching cost)
3. **Not-on-the-BOM gating item** (small line item that gates commissioning/uptime)
4. **Waste/byproduct/safety at scale** (binding only when scaled)
5. **Working-capital/financing node** (inventory, letters of credit, surety, insurance, vendor finance)
6. **Integration bottleneck** (system integrator + specialized labor + relationships)
7. **Aftermarket/installed-base service** (spares, uptime contracts)
8. **Measurement/QA/metrology node** (testing, certification, traceability)

# Your Task

Produce ONE holistic investment thesis + impact map with at least ONE meaningful Layer 3+ opportunity.

**Important sequencing rule**: Do not jump to "money-as-physics" until you complete worldview reconstruction and thesis selection. This prevents generic drift and forces you to carry the author's specific mental model into the capital-flow map.

# Process (Execute in Order)

## Step 0 — Evidence Ledger + Worldview Reconstruction

**Purpose**: Pin yourself to what the author actually believes and prioritizes, so you deduce capital flows from THEIR logic, not your default macro template.

### Step 0.1 — Evidence Ledger

Extract 15-25 atomic claims/facts from the article content. For each:
- Assign an **Anchor ID** (A1, A2, A3, ...)
- Provide **direct quote or faithful paraphrase**
- Assign **tag**: FACT / INTENT / FORECAST / FRAME
- Assign **evidence grade**: E1 / E2 / E3
- Note **why it matters**: what it constrains or forces in the model

Present in a table or structured list for easy reference. It's OK for this section to be quite long.

### Step 0.2 — Identify Thesis Carrier

- Name the speaker/author who carries the thesis
- Justify why (agency, expertise, responsibility, repeated claims)
- If single author: simply confirm

### Step 0.3 — Material Map

Create 8-12 bullets in the original order from the article. Use this template for each:

**Actor/lever → action → object (concrete noun) → mechanism (because...) → implied payer (who will fund it)**

### Step 0.4 — Author Tokens

Extract 12-20 of the most concrete ideas/facts/events the author uses. These tokens are your "grounding vocabulary"—prefer to reuse them later to avoid generic drift.

### Step 0.5 — Worldview Reconstruction

Based on the Evidence Ledger (cite anchor IDs throughout):

**Success drivers**: 3-6 bullets explaining what makes outcomes succeed (cite A#)

**Failure modes**: 3-6 bullets explaining what causes failure (cite A#)

**Agency map**: Who can move outcomes—buyers, regulators, firms, institutions (cite A#)

## Step 0.6 — Thesis Candidate Generation

Generate 3 thesis candidates. Each must be one conditional sentence:

**"If structural change X, then world outcome Y because mechanism Z."**

Score each candidate 1-5 on:
- **Explicitness**: supported by E1/E2 anchors
- **Agency clarity**: who decides/pays is clear
- **Transmission to invoices**: can name invoice-level items without major guessing
- **Persistence**: structural, not a one-off event
- **Specificity**: uses Author Tokens, avoids generic filler

For each candidate, explicitly note the score for each dimension (e.g., "Explicitness: 4/5, Agency clarity: 3/5...").

Select ONE winning thesis and justify in 2-4 sentences why it wins.

## Step 0.7 — Contract-Form Test (Mandatory Gate)

For the winning thesis, trace the complete chain:

**Payer → Contract Vehicle → Invoice Line Items → Bottlenecks/Gates → Timing**

Provide:
- **Payer**: who authorizes spend (name the entity type: government, corporation, utility, etc.)
- **Contract vehicle**: procurement, offtake, project finance, subsidy, regulated RAB, lease, service contract
- **Invoice line items**: 3-5 specific purchasable things (use Author Tokens where possible)
- **Bottlenecks/gates**: 2-3 constraints that could block the spend
- **Timing**: 0-12m / 12-36m / 36m+ for major spend to flow

**Decision**: Does the thesis pass? (Yes/No + brief justification)

If No, revise thesis or select next candidate and repeat test.

## Step 1 — Capital Flow Map (Money-as-Physics)

**Purpose**: Convert worldview into "who writes checks for what"—this turns narrative into investable reality.

Structure this as three linked subsections to maintain auditability and avoid narrative drift.

### Step 1A — Payer Graph

Identify the top 3-5 **spend buckets** implied by the winning thesis.

For each spend bucket:
- **Name** (use Author Tokens if possible)
- **Anchors supporting it**: list A# and note if E3-heavy
- **Buyer** (who authorizes spend)
- **CAPEX vs OPEX**
- **Contract form**: procurement / offtake / project finance / subsidy / regulated RAB / lease / service
- **Timing**: 0-12m / 12-36m / 36m+
- **Dollar gravity**: Large / Medium / Small + one-line justification

### Step 1B — Contract/Invoice/KPI Map

For each spend bucket from 1A, provide:

**Invoice-level items**: List 4-8 specific purchasable things or contract lines

**Unit economics of reality**:
- Define the unit of output that must scale (MW, tons, units/year, km corridor, etc.)
- Express spend as: Units × $/Unit × adoption pace (use ranges)
- For each parameter label: Author-sourced (cite A#) or External inference (E4)

**BOM + capacity**: For largest bucket(s), list 6-10 key inputs/components. Mark which are likely supply-constrained (lead time, certification, scarce materials, few plants). If constraint is not supported by E1-E3, label it E4.

**Margin reality note** (mandatory):
- Where pricing power can exist and why (mechanism + contract structure)
- Where spend may be large but margins competed away (and why)

### Step 1C — Gate Ledger

For the 2-3 most critical gating constraints identified in Step 1A-1B:

For each gate:
- **Gate name/description**
- **Who controls it**: which entity or entities (companies, regulators, standards bodies)
- **Lead time**: how long to resolve (months/years)
- **Failure modes**: what breaks if gate is not resolved (be specific)
- **Anchors**: cite A# or label E4 if inference
- **How it affects pricing power**: does resolving this gate create or destroy margins, and why

## Step 2 — First-Principles Consequence Engine

**Purpose**: Test internal logic of the thesis and articulate the "must-happen-next" chain in reality.

Given the thesis is TRUE (axiom):

**Necessary conditions**: What must also become true (cite anchors or label E4)

**Sufficient accelerants**: What makes it happen faster / at larger scale

**Tipping points**: Thresholds where the system flips (capacity, safety, logistics, qualification cycles)

**Branches** (2-3): How the same premise routes capital differently (substitution, geopolitics, tech path)
- Branches are the correct place for E4-heavy constraints and alternative paths

**Second-order effects**: What gets competed away vs what remains defensible, and why

## Step 2.5 — Opportunity Swarm

**Purpose**: Increase "idea surface area" while controlling drift by scoring and selecting only the best, most grounded candidates.

Generate 15-30 opportunity candidates across at least 5 Alpha Archetypes.

Use 3 perspectives (each produces 5-10 candidates):
- **Procurement officer perspective**
- **Plant commissioning manager perspective**
- **CFO / underwriter / trade-finance perspective**

For each candidate provide:
- **Name** (invoice-level oriented)
- **Archetype(s)** (pick 1-3 from the Alpha Archetypes list)
- **Causal chain** (3-6 links, each with explicit "because...")
- **Where money is paid**: buyer + contract mechanism + invoice-level item + timing
- **Why mispriced**: classification error / opacity / wrong cyclicality / private→public proxy / low coverage
- **Anchor linkage**: cite A#; mark if E3-heavy or E4 branch

Score each candidate 0-5 on:
- Anchor strength (penalize E3-heavy; heavily penalize E4)
- Dollar gravity
- Gatingness
- Supplier scarcity
- Mispricing strength
- Investability

For each candidate, explicitly calculate and show the total score.

It's OK for this section to be quite long.

Select **TOP 3 winners** with diversity constraints:
- At least 2 different archetypes
- Not all from the same spend bucket
- At least 2 must be primarily E1/E2 anchored

## Step 3 — Impact Mapping (Minimum 4 Loops; Must Reach Layer 3+)

**Purpose**: Walk from obvious beneficiaries to bottlenecks to mispriced, indirect nodes without losing the money trail.

Run at least 4 deduction loops. Each loop must include:

1. **What the thesis forces next, and why** (mechanism)
2. **Who solves it and required capabilities** (technical, operational, qualification, relationships)
3. **New problems that appear only at scale**
4. **Dollar-check**:
   - Where money is paid (CAPEX/OPEX; unit × volume × price)
   - Is it a large-dollar bucket or a gating item for one?

**Non-obviousness gate**: If it sounds like a headline trade, push at least one layer deeper to a gating node with pricing power.

## Step 4 — Select 1-3 Best Layer 3+ Opportunities

**Purpose**: Turn the map into investable decision-grade targets.

Use ONLY the Top 3 winners from Step 2.5.

For each selected Layer 3+ opportunity provide:

**Opportunity name**

**Full causal chain**: Every link explicit (thesis → constraint → induced demand → who solves → why value captured)

**Weakest link**: What breaks value capture (not whether thesis is true)

**Required capabilities**:
- Capability 1 — why required
- Qualification/regulatory — why required
- Operational capability — why required
- Distribution/relationship — why required

**Market structure**:
- Estimated viable players: [range + why]
- Key barriers to entry
- Why incumbents can't easily pivot (if applicable)

**Value capture mechanism**: Where it sits in the value chain and why it can extract value

**Pricing power**: Explain monopoly/oligopoly/forced buyer/commodity using mechanism, not labels

**Revenue model**: One-time/recurring/usage-based — explain

**Window**: Opens/closes + triggers

**Why non-obvious**: What chain of reasoning most analysts miss

**Mispricing mechanism**: Why markets misread it

**Company identification criteria**:
- Must-have attributes
- Differentiators
- Key metrics (financial and operational)
- What to look for in reports/calls
- Red flags
- Geography considerations

**Critical dependencies & breakpoints**:
- Sequential vs parallel layers
- Where cascade most likely breaks
- Best margin profile and why
- Leading indicators to monitor

**Investability**: Public proxies if the true winner is private

# Your Analysis Process

Before producing your final structured output, work through your analysis systematically inside your thinking block:

1. Work through Steps 0.1-0.7 (Evidence Ledger through Contract-Form Test) inside <analysis> tags in your thinking block

2. Evaluate whether your winning thesis passes the Contract-Form Test inside <thesis_evaluation> tags in your thinking block

3. Work through Steps 1A-1C (Payer Graph, Contract/Invoice/KPI Map, Gate Ledger) inside <capital_physics> tags in your thinking block

4. Work through Steps 2-2.5 (Consequences and Opportunity Swarm) inside <opportunity_reasoning> tags in your thinking block

5. After completing your chain-of-thought analysis in the thinking block, provide your final structured output following the Required Output Structure exactly

Your final output should consist only of the structured sections (0 through 4) as specified in the Required Output Structure, and should not duplicate or rehash any of the detailed working you did in the thinking block.

Begin your analysis now.

This will help for the next stage: Stage 1 - Sub-segment Validation (thesis-derived only).
◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
ROLE
You are a PhD-level investment analyst and systems thinker; you assume the thesis is TRUE, deduce where capital must flow, then select the best public stocks to capture that flow with the best risk/reward.

OPERATING PRINCIPLES
Assume the thesis is correct; do not debate it.
Use first principles and deduction; avoid generic MBA frameworks unless a stage explicitly calls for a tool. When structure is needed, use the workflow’s invoice-first mechanics: payer → contract mechanism → invoice items → gates/bottlenecks → timing funnel → delivered pool.
Be conservative when data is missing; label DATA vs ASSUMPTION vs INFERENCE.

CONTEXT IS THE DATASET (critical)
No extra input data will be provided.
You must continuously use the full conversation as your dataset: inherit the Thesis Object and reuse all earlier stage outputs, lists, assumptions, and constraints already present anywhere in the chat.
Only after searching the conversation should you use the internet to verify facts and fill gaps.

TIME ANCHOR (MANDATORY): Set one Anchor Date as the latest available reported baseline (TTM or FY, explicitly chosen) and keep it fixed across the entire workflow. Revenue₀, FCF₀/margin₀, net debt/cash, diluted shares, and all CORE/WEDGE/TOTAL scenarios must use the same Anchor Date and the same convention (TTM vs FY). If the Anchor Date changes, you must rebase and recompute Stage 2.5, Stage 6, and Stage 8 outputs (and Stage 7 if present).

WEB DATA (mandatory)
Validate tickers, prices, shares, net debt, segment mix, KPIs, and filings using reputable sources: company IR filings, Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, stock exchange pages, and other major financial databases.
If sources conflict, prefer filings/IR first, then official exchange data, then aggregators; state what you used.
Do not invent numbers; if you must assume, make it explicit and conservative.

DEFINITIONS (use consistently)
Thesis premise: “If X, then Y because Z” structural claim we assume is true.
Capital flow: who pays, via what contract/budget, for what invoice-level items, on what timeline.
Invoice-level item: a concrete purchasable line item (equipment, component, project, service contract).
Gating constraint: the bottleneck that must be solved for scaling (capacity, lead time, qualification, physics, logistics).
Layer 3+: indirect beneficiaries 2–3 steps removed that sit on big dollars or unblock gates.


In the next stages you will conduct following steps:
Compliance can be mentioned, but it cannot be the core value capture unless it is a true gating constraint, economically material/recurring, and the supplier set is structurally limited.

STAGE STRUCTURE (use this order; one sentence each on what we care about)

Stage 0 — Thesis Object Inheritance
We care about importing the existing Thesis Object and earlier outputs from this conversation and not rebuilding Stage 0.

Stage 1 — Sub-segment Validation (thesis-derived only)
We care about converting the thesis into 5–8 precise sub-segments defined by what buyers purchase, stress-testing structure and timing, then selecting the top 2–3 to carry forward.

Stage 2 — Stock Universe (15 names)
We care about producing 15 public companies mapped to the top sub-segments with a clear thesis exposure mechanism, value-chain role, and the single biggest risk.

Stage 2.5 — Reverse DCF Lite + Driver-of-Value Screen (fast filter)
We care about checking whether the market is already pricing the base case and identifying whether value is driven mainly by growth, margins, or WACC, then classifying names as ADVANCE/WATCH/DROP.

Stage 3 — Competitive Position (4 finalists)
We care about selecting 4 finalists with the strongest value-capture position (replaceability, scarce assets/capacity, qualification, relationships) and explicit fit to gating constraints.

Stage 4 — DuPont ROE Quality
We care about decomposing ROE to confirm whether returns are operational or leverage-driven and how the thesis changes margin, asset efficiency, and leverage over ~3 years.

Stage 5 — Revaluation Parameter Selection
We care about selecting ONE measurable Revaluation Parameter with the highest probability-weighted potential to force a near-term market revaluation.

Stage 6 — Thesis Monetization (incremental only, SoP-compatible)
We care about quantifying only incremental thesis cash flows (Bear/Base/Bull) and converting them into an incremental NPV/share delta with assumptions labeled SOURCE/ASSUMPTION.

Stage 7 — Reverse DCF (whole company, consistent valuation object)
We care about solving market-implied growth/margins via root-finding on a whole-company valuation (or consistent SoP) and measuring divergence versus your Base case.

Stage 8 — Four-Gate Decision (final BUY/WATCH/AVOID)
We care about producing the only allowed final decision using Quality, Value, Proof, and Execution gates, plus an executable entry/add/reduce/exit plan.

Stage 9 — Position State Machine (final)
We care about managing an open position mechanically (profit protection, spike handling, exits, cooldown, and re-entry) using explicit observable triggers.

START RULE
Don't execute them. just remmeber this fact, think about it, and starting from the next stage follow.

This will help for the next stage: Stage 1 - Sub-segment Validation (thesis-derived only).
◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►

You are an investment research engineer working within a multi-stage investment analysis pipeline. Your task is to transform an inherited investment thesis into an operational "market map in invoice form," then generate and evaluate candidate sub-segments to identify the top 2–3 for downstream company selection.

**Important framing**: This is a strictly engineering stage. You are NOT creating new investment narratives or validating whether the thesis is true. Your role is to translate the thesis into concrete specifications—what is purchased, by whom, under what contract structure, what blocks it, and when it materializes—so that the next stage can select companies by their exposure to specific invoice line items rather than by broad industry labels.
**What each input represents**:
- `winning_thesis`: A single conditional statement in "If X then Y because Z" format
- `thesis_rationale`: An explanation of why this thesis was selected and which mechanisms are "core"
- `contract_map`: Inherited elements from prior analysis including payer/buyer, possible contract vehicles, example invoice line items, gates/bottlenecks, and timing bands (0–12m, 12–36m, 36m+)
- `control_tokens`: Concrete nouns and mechanisms that anchor sub-segments to the thesis and prevent drift into generic categories
- `disconfirmers`: Breakpoints for designing measurable Value of Information (VOI) indicators in later stages

## Your Task: Four Required Mechanics

### MECHANIC 1: Sub-Segment Derivation

**Derive** 5–8 sub-segments by splitting and refining the inherited `contract_map`. Do NOT invent segments from scratch or sort pre-existing categories. Instead, systematically split the inherited elements wherever economic boundaries exist.

A sub-segment must be separated into its own distinct segment if ANY of the following change:
- **Payer/buyer identity** (e.g., federal government vs state utility vs private corporation)
- **Contract form** (e.g., procurement contract vs Rate Base / Regulated Asset Base vs offtake agreement vs SaaS/OPEX subscription)
- **Invoice type** (e.g., CAPEX equipment purchase vs OPEX subscription vs service/aftermarket revenue)
- **Critical gate** (e.g., regulatory qualification vs throughput/capacity vs system integration vs testing/QA vs working capital availability)
- **Funnel timing** (e.g., different phases in policy→award→backlog→delivery progression)

**Why this matters**: These splits ensure that sub-segments are economically distinct—different in how money flows, who controls it, and what risks block it—not just cosmetically different labels.

### MECHANIC 2: Invoice-First Definition

Every sub-segment must include a hard-format, invoice-first definition with exactly six components:

1. **Payer/buyer**: Who actually pays the invoice
2. **Contract form and budget type**: The specific contracting mechanism (e.g., "DoD procurement contract," "utility Rate-Based CAPEX," "corporate OPEX subscription")
3. **Invoice issuer**: Who sends the invoice and receives payment
4. **Invoice items**: 6–12 concrete, specific line items—things that can actually be purchased and have identifiable suppliers (e.g., "thermal management modules," "AI inference accelerators," "per-seat SaaS licenses," "certification testing services")
5. **Gates/bottlenecks**: 1–3 specific gates, each including:
   - What exactly blocks scaling
   - Who controls the gate
   - Typical lead time to clear the gate
   - **Gate quality classification** (mandatory):
     - **A (Hard Scarcity)**: Physical/technical constraint, scarce capacity, multi-year qualification
     - **B (Soft Process)**: Regulatory/procedural, but can be scaled with hiring and process
     - **C (Price-Controlled)**: Utility-style regulation, visible margin caps, limited rent capture
   - **Implication for margin sustainability**: 1–2 sentences on whether this gate protects margin or allows fast commoditization
6. **Capture point**: Where margin can realistically be retained (e.g., prime contractor, gatekeeper, systems integrator, aftermarket/service provider)—this is the seed of competitive moat and filters against confusing large spending pools with large profit pools

### MECHANIC 3: Future Capital Flow Mapping

For each sub-segment, map not just where cash flows today, but **through what channel it MUST flow if the thesis proves true**. Draw the complete funnel over time:

**Budget decision → Obligation/award → Backlog → Delivery → Revenue recognition → Cash**

Describe delays and friction at each stage. Crucially, distinguish:
- **Announced** (statements of intent, policy goals)
- **Awarded** (binding contract or obligation)
- **Delivered** (actual goods/services provided and invoiced)

**This distinction is critical**: Confusing announced intent with awarded contracts is the single largest source of analytical error in investment research.

Connect S-curve timing to contract timing: if a segment has only intent signals without binding awards, classify it as an earlier phase and assign lower confidence.

### MECHANIC 4: Sizing in Invoice Objects

For each sub-segment, provide Low/Base/High "Invoice Pool" ranges calculated using BOTH of these methods:
- **Method 1**: Plan/budget → market share allocation
- **Method 2**: Unit-based bottom-up calculation

Apply strict labeling discipline:
- **SOURCE**: Information directly from plans, budgets, public filings, or regulatory documents
- **ASSUMPTION**: Your analytical inference or estimation

Under uncertainty, shrink the Base case conservatively.

Then convert the Invoice Pool to a **Delivered Pool** for Y1/Y2/Y3 by applying **feasibility caps** based on gate lead times. 

**Critical constraint**: If a gate has an 18–36 month lead time, you CANNOT assume half the market will be delivered in Y1. The delivered pool must respect the actual contracting and delivery timeline.

This sizing discipline ensures compatibility with:
- **Stage 2.5** (wedge realism: does required revenue under current valuation fit within the realistic pool?)
- **Stage 6** (monetization modeling: what is the actual path from budget to cash?)

## Additional Required Checks (Based on User Feedback)

### Check 1: Supply Response Assessment

For each sub-segment, perform a **Supply Response Check** evaluating how quickly supply can scale to meet demand. Consider these criteria:

1. **CAPEX intensity**: How much upfront capital is required to add supply capacity?
2. **Lead times**: How long to build/deploy new capacity (facilities, equipment, infrastructure)?
3. **Qualification duration**: How long to achieve customer qualification, certifications, or approvals (>24 months indicates slow response)?
4. **Scarcity of inputs**: Are labs, testing facilities, raw materials, or specialized talent scarce?
5. **Liability/trust barriers**: Do switching costs, safety considerations, or trust relationships slow new entrants?
6. **Single points of failure**: Are there bottleneck steps controlled by few players?

Based on this evaluation, classify supply response as:
- **Fast**: New capacity can come online in <12 months, limited barriers to entry → margin compression risk
- **Medium**: 12–24 months to scale, moderate barriers → margins depend on demand growth pace
- **Slow**: >24 months, high barriers, scarce resources → margin sustainability likely

Provide a 1–2 sentence justification for your classification.

### Check 2: Regulation vs Moat Distinction

In your gate quality classification (A/B/C), explicitly distinguish:
- Gates that create **hard scarcity** (limited by physics, capacity, or multi-year qualification) → protect margin
- Gates that are **soft processes** (hiring, procedure, certification that can scale) → temporary moat only
- Gates that are **price-controlled** (utility regulation, cost-plus contracts) → limited margin capture

This prevents the error of treating regulatory approval processes as durable moats when they may simply create temporary bottlenecks that resolve through hiring and process.

## Ranking and Selection

Rank all 5–8 sub-segments across these four axes:

1. **Strength of forced capital flow**: How certain is it that capital MUST flow through this channel if the thesis is true? (Consider contract maturity: announced vs awarded vs in backlog)
2. **Gate scarcity/control quality**: Based on gate quality classification (A/B/C), how durable is the barrier? Who controls it?
3. **Supply response risk**: Based on your Supply Response Check, how fast can competitors scale to capture the opportunity?
4. **Timing / contracting maturity**: How far along is the budget→award→backlog→delivery funnel? Earlier stages carry higher uncertainty.

Provide **explicit reasoning** for each sub-segment's score on each axis.

Select the **top 2–3 sub-segments** based on this ranking. Justify your selection with reference to the four axes.

## Output Requirements

Your analysis must produce three artifacts that enable downstream stages to work without re-processing data:

### ARTIFACT 1: Sub-Segment Catalog

A catalog of all 5–8 sub-segments, each in a unified format containing:
- **Sub-segment name**
- **Invoice-first definition** with all six components (payer, contract form, invoice items, gates with quality classification and margin implications, capture point)
- **Timing funnel** (budget→award→backlog→delivery with specific lead times and delays at each stage)
- **Invoice Pool sizing** (Low/Base/High with both calculation methods and SOURCE/ASSUMPTION labels clearly marked)
- **Delivered pool Y1/Y2/Y3** (with feasibility caps from gate lead times applied and explained)
- **Supply Response Check** (Fast/Medium/Slow with criteria evaluation and justification)

### ARTIFACT 2: Ranking & Selection

- **Ranking table** showing all sub-segments with scores or qualitative assessments on the four axes
- **Explicit reasoning** for each sub-segment's ranking on each axis
- **Selection of top 2–3** with detailed justification referencing the ranking

### ARTIFACT 3: Handoff Pack

For each of the top 2–3 selected sub-segments, create a complete handoff pack containing:
- Buyer/payer
- Contract mechanism
- Invoice items (the 6–12 line items)
- Gates (with quality classification, control, and lead time)
- Timing funnel (with phase transitions and delays documented)
- Invoice Pool Low/Base/High
- Delivered Y1–Y3 (with feasibility constraints)
- 2–3 **measurable VOI/falsifiers** in 6–18 month horizon (leading indicators that would confirm or disconfirm the sub-segment's viability)

## Downstream Integration Context

Your outputs feed directly into these subsequent stages:

- **Stage 2**: Uses invoice items and capture point to map companies by exposure to specific invoices
- **Stage 2.5**: Uses annualized/Y3 invoice pool + confidence to test "does required revenue under current valuation fit within the realistic pool?"
- **Stage 3**: Uses gates as moat and replaceability objects (who controls gate, how hard to replicate)
- **Stage 6**: Uses contract type + timing funnel to select monetization template (backlog conversion vs budget→contract→revenue vs installed-base/annuity models)

Ensuring precision and completeness in your outputs is essential for these downstream stages to function correctly.

## Process and Output Structure

Work through your analysis systematically inside `<scratchpad>` tags in your thinking block. It's OK for this section to be quite long given the complexity of the analysis. Follow this process:

1. **Extract inherited elements**: From the contract_map, list out all the inherited elements:
   - All payer/buyer types mentioned
   - All contract vehicles mentioned
   - All example invoice line items mentioned
   - All gates/bottlenecks mentioned
   - All timing bands mentioned
   This keeps the raw material visible for the next steps.

2. **Identify economic boundaries**: Review the inherited elements and explicitly identify where economic boundaries exist that require splitting sub-segments (changes in payer, contract form, invoice type, critical gate, or funnel timing).

3. **Derive 5–8 candidate sub-segments**: Based on the economic boundaries identified, systematically split the inherited elements into 5–8 distinct sub-segments. For each, give it a working name.

4. **Build invoice-first definitions**: For each candidate sub-segment, methodically work through all six required components:
   - Component 1 (Payer/buyer): [specify]
   - Component 2 (Contract form): [specify]
   - Component 3 (Invoice issuer): [specify]
   - Component 4 (Invoice items): [list 6-12 specific items]
   - Component 5 (Gates): For each gate, work through:
     * What blocks scaling
     * Who controls it
     * Lead time
     * Gate quality classification (A/B/C) with explicit reasoning for the classification
     * Margin implication (1-2 sentences)
   - Component 6 (Capture point): [specify where margin is retained]

5. **Map capital flow funnels**: For each sub-segment, trace through the complete funnel (Budget decision → Obligation/award → Backlog → Delivery → Revenue recognition → Cash), documenting timing, delays, and friction at each stage. Explicitly note whether signals are announced/awarded/delivered.

6. **Size invoice and delivered pools**: For each sub-segment:
   - Calculate Low/Base/High using Method 1 (plan/budget → share) with SOURCE/ASSUMPTION labels
   - Calculate Low/Base/High using Method 2 (unit-based) with SOURCE/ASSUMPTION labels
   - Apply feasibility caps based on gate lead times to convert to Y1/Y2/Y3 delivered pools
   - Document the constraint logic for each year

7. **Perform systematic checks**: For each sub-segment:
   - Supply Response Check: Evaluate across all 6 criteria (CAPEX intensity, lead times, qualification duration, scarcity of inputs, liability/trust barriers, single points of failure), then classify as Fast/Medium/Slow with justification
   - Verify gate quality classifications distinguish hard scarcity vs soft process vs price-controlled

8. **Create ranking table and select**: 
   - Build a table with all sub-segments and their assessment on each of the four axes
   - For each sub-segment, write explicit reasoning for its score on each axis
   - Based on the ranking, identify the top 2–3 sub-segments and justify the selection

**After completing your scratchpad work**, provide your final output in this structure:

[For each of 5–8 sub-segments:]

Sub-segment name: [Name]

Invoice-First Definition:
  1. Payer/buyer: [Who pays]
  2. Contract form and budget type: [Specific mechanism]
  3. Invoice issuer: [Who bills]
  4. Invoice items: [6-12 specific line items]
  5. Gates/bottlenecks:
     - Gate 1: [What blocks scale] | [Who controls] | [Lead time] | Quality: [A/B/C] | Margin implication: [1-2 sentences]
     - Gate 2: [if applicable]
     - Gate 3: [if applicable]
  6. Capture point: [Where margin is retained]

Timing Funnel:
  - Budget decision: [timing and status]
  - Obligation/award: [timing and delays]
  - Backlog: [timing and conversion rate]
  - Delivery: [timing and constraints]
  - Revenue recognition → Cash: [timing considerations]
  [Note distinctions between announced/awarded/delivered]

Invoice Pool Sizing:
  - Method 1 (Plan/budget → share): Low [X] | Base [Y] | High [Z] [SOURCE/ASSUMPTION labels]
  - Method 2 (Unit-based bottom-up): Low [X] | Base [Y] | High [Z] [SOURCE/ASSUMPTION labels]
  
Delivered Pool (with feasibility caps):
  - Y1: [Amount and constraint explanation]
  - Y2: [Amount and constraint explanation]
  - Y3: [Amount and constraint explanation]

Supply Response Check: [Fast/Medium/Slow]
  - Criteria evaluation: [Brief assessment across 5-6 criteria]
  - Justification: [1-2 sentences]


This will help for the next stage: Stage 2 - Stock Universe (15 names).
◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►

You are an expert investment analyst. Your task is to identify 15 high-conviction stock picks based on a specific investment thesis that has already been translated in Stage 1 into invoice-first sub-segments (payer/contract/invoice items/gates/timing funnel + invoice pool and delivered pool ranges).
## Input: Thesis + Stage 1 Sub-Segment Validation Outputs (Invoice-First Market Map)

The thesis for your investment along with the Stage 1 sub-segment catalog + selected top 2–3 sub-segments are above:

You MUST inherit both the thesis and the selected sub-segments from this input. This includes the specific definitions of:
- Who pays (the actual buyers making spending decisions)
- Invoice items (what specifically appears on invoices)
- Contract mechanisms (how deals are structured)
- Timing funnel (the path from commitment to revenue)
- Invoice pool ranges (Low/Base/High estimates with confidence levels)

Do not start from scratch or redefine these elements. Your job is to map these already-defined cash flows to specific companies.

## Context

You have already completed an initial analysis that:

Defined a specific investment thesis

Derived 2–3 invoice-first sub-segments (Stage 1) that carry the thesis cash flows

Mapped who pays, what is invoiced (invoice items), the contract mechanism, gates, and the timing funnel from budget to cash
Your current task is to translate this thesis and sub-segment analysis into a concrete, auditable basket of 15 publicly-traded companies. The critical requirement is to identify companies with genuine exposure to the capital flows identified in your thesis—not companies that merely sound thematically related.

## Data Search and Validation Policy

You will need to gather data to validate company exposure, financials, and market positioning. Follow these requirements:

**Search Requirements:**
- Use web search to validate: tickers, listings, currency, market caps, current prices, shares outstanding, net debt/cash positions, and segment information
- Prefer this source hierarchy: company filings/investor relations → official exchange data → reputable aggregators
- Document EVERY search query you use (not just in Phase 6)
- Search queries and results should be recorded in your systematic analysis working space

**Handling Missing Data:**
When you cannot find a critical number, do NOT stop your analysis. Instead:

1. Use the Proxy Ladder (in this priority order):
   - **A) Company filings/IR**: Look for segment revenue, backlog, customer mix, recurring revenue mix
   - **B) Official exchange or government statistics**: Market data, regulatory filings
   - **C) Reputable aggregators**: Use at least 2 sources and reconcile differences
   - **D) Peer-implied proxy**: Find the closest comparable company with disclosed data, transfer the ratio/mix with explicit scaling factors
   - **E) Conservative priors**: Create wide ranges using industry norms, then shrink the Base case toward the conservative end

2. Clearly label what you're doing:
   - Mark as **SOURCE** when you have direct evidence
   - Mark as **ASSUMPTION** when using proxies or priors
   - Mark as **INFERENCE** when deriving from other known facts
   - Always note your confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

3. For peer-implied proxies (Method D):
   - Select 1-2 closest peers that DO disclose the relevant data
   - Explicitly state how you're transferring the data (geography, customer set, product scope adjustments)
   - Use wide bounds (at least ±50% relative)
   - Apply shrinkage toward the conservative end for your Base case
   - Document: "Using [Peer Name]'s disclosed [metric] of X%, adjusted by [factors], yields range of [Y%-Z%] for [Target Company]"

**Critical Rule:** Never silently invent numbers. Every proxy must be explicitly explained with your reasoning.

## Seven-Phase Analysis Framework

Work through these seven phases systematically. Conduct all your reasoning, research queries, calculations, and filtering decisions inside <systematic_analysis> tags in your thinking block before presenting your final recommendations.

### Phase 1: Thesis Decomposition & Capital Flow Analysis

**Objective:** Break down the thesis into its fundamental mechanics and validate the inherited Stage 1 invoice-first sub-segment logic (payer/contract/invoice items/gates/timing + invoice pool and delivered pool).

**Tasks:**

1. **Extract Source Reasoning (Capital Flow Physics):**
   - First, quote the key passages from the thesis document that describe who is paying, what they're paying for, and why
   - Then identify who is actually paying TODAY (not "will want to" pay)
   - Identify which value chain elements cannot be easily replicated
   - Determine if spending decisions are concentrated (few large buyers) or fragmented (many small buyers)

2. **Map Value Flows by Order:**
   - **1st order**: Direct recipients of new spending (who gets the invoice?)
   - **2nd order**: Suppliers and enablers to 1st order recipients
   - **3rd order**: Bottlenecks and constraints that must scale for the thesis to work
   - **4th order**: Unintended beneficiaries with hidden leverage

3. **Identify Structural Mechanisms (Non-linear exploders):**
   - Non-bypassable chokepoints in the value chain
   - Operational leverage points (where 2x volume → 4x profit or more)
   - Asymmetric access advantages (regulatory moats, proprietary data, network effects)

4. **Document Dynamic Timing Evidence:**
   - Signs of tension NOW: extended lead times, growing backlogs, pricing power exceeding volume growth
   - Transitions from project-based → long-term contracts (increasing revenue visibility)
   - Regulatory or technology changes activating latent economic power

**Output in your systematic analysis:** Document your reasoning for each element above, quoting specific parts of the thesis that support your conclusions. Show how capital will actually flow. It's OK for this section to be quite long.

### Phase 2: Market Segmentation & Opportunity Sizing

**Objective:** Quantify the revenue opportunity using the inherited invoice pools, not abstract TAM estimates.

**Tasks:**

1. **Use Inherited Invoice Pools as Primary Sizing Object:**
   - Start with the Low/Base/High invoice pool ranges from Phase 1
   - These pools represent the actual spending that will create invoices

2. **Convert Invoice Pool → Revenue Opportunity:**
   - Apply the timing funnel: Awards/Commitments → Backlog → Delivered Revenue → Cash Collection
   - Make the funnel conversion explicit: "Pool of $XB in awards over [timeframe] → converts to revenue over [delivery period] → yields annual revenue run-rate of $YB"
   - Account for conversion losses at each stage (not all awards convert, not all backlog delivers on time)

3. **If Building/Updating Pool Estimates:**
   Use at least two methods:
   - **(i) Plan/budget-based sizing**: Government budgets, corporate capex plans, disclosed programs
   - **(ii) Asset/unit-based sizing**: Number of units (facilities, vehicles, users) × spending per unit
   - Reconcile the two methods; if they diverge significantly, widen your range

4. **Apply Proxy Ladder for Missing Data:**
   - If numeric anchors are missing, use the Proxy Ladder (from Data Search Policy above)
   - Produce numeric Low/Base/High ranges even with incomplete data
   - Always label: SOURCE vs ASSUMPTION vs INFERENCE with confidence

5. **Document Assumptions:**
   - Growth trajectory assumptions over 3-5 years
   - Current penetration rates (if measurable)
   - Key adoption drivers that would accelerate the opportunity
   - Key barriers that could slow or stop adoption

**Output in your systematic analysis:** Show your calculations explicitly. Write out formulas, inputs, and results. State all assumptions clearly.

### Phase 3: Company Universe Generation (Exposure-Based)

**Objective:** Identify 20-30 candidate companies and calculate their genuine exposure to the thesis using evidence-based methods.

**Target Distribution for Final 15:**
- **Core Plays**: 6-9 companies (thesis exposure >40% of company value)
- **Material Plays**: 4-6 companies (thesis exposure 20-40% of company value)
- **Catalytic Plays**: 0-3 companies (thesis exposure 10-20% of company value, Category Leaders only)

**Prioritization Rules:**
1. Small-cap with 60% exposure > Large-cap with 15% exposure
2. If you find 12+ Core Play candidates → select best 9, reduce or skip Material/Catalytic
3. If thesis naturally clusters in one market cap segment → embrace it, don't force artificial diversity
4. Eliminate Catalytic tier entirely if 15 strong Core + Material candidates exist

**Liquidity Floor:**
- Maximum 3 companies with average daily trading volume <$5M
- If thesis points to >3 illiquid opportunities, flag them for position sizing (<2% each)
- Never exclude a Core Play solely due to liquidity—adjust position sizing instead

**Tasks:**

1. **Generate Initial Candidate List (20-30 companies):**
   - Focus on value chain positions identified in Phase 1
   - Prioritize companies at the points where invoices are generated (or bottlenecks that gate those invoices)

2. **Calculate Thesis Exposure Using Evidence-Based Methods:**

   For EACH candidate company, you MUST:
   
   **First, gather and list the evidence:**
   - What segment revenue information is disclosed in their filings?
   - What customer concentration data is available?
   - What backlog or order book details are provided?
   - What recurring revenue mix is disclosed?
   - If using peers: which specific peers disclose relevant data, and what are those numbers?
   
   **Then, compute thesis exposure using one of these methods:**

   **Method A: Backlog/Orders-Based (for project businesses)**
   - Formula: Exposure ≈ (Revenue or backlog tied to thesis sub-segment invoice items) / Total revenue
   - Data sources: Filings/IR segment revenue disclosures, backlog disclosures
   - If only backlog disclosed: Annual conversion = Backlog / Average project duration (use range)
   - If data missing: Cap exposure at 20% maximum and downgrade to Material or Catalytic tier

   **Method B: Budget/Program-Based (for defense/government services integrators)**
   - Formula: Exposure ≈ (Revenue from relevant agencies/programs/budget line items) / Total revenue
   - Data sources: Customer concentration disclosures, agency revenue mix, contract backlog by customer

   **Method C: Installed Base/Recurring Mix (for software/subscription businesses)**
   - Formula: Exposure ≈ (Recurring revenue tied to thesis invoice items) / Total revenue
   - Data sources: ARR disclosures, recurring revenue mix, product segment breakdowns

   **Method D: Peer-Implied Exposure (ALWAYS-RUN fallback when A/B/C unavailable)**
   - Select 1-2 closest peers that DO disclose relevant segment mix
   - Transfer the segment exposure as a prior, scaling with explicit factors (geography, customer set, product scope)
   - Use wide bounds (at least ±50% relative range)
   - Apply shrinkage toward conservative end for Base case
   - **Important limitation**: This method may NOT create a Core Play. Cap at Material unless you later validate with Method A/B/C evidence
   - Document: "Using [Peer]'s disclosed [segment] exposure of X%, adjusted for [factors], yields estimated range [Y%-Z%] for [Company]"

   **If None of A/B/C/D Can Be Supported:**
   - Set exposure range = 0%-20% (conservative)
   - Label confidence as LOW
   - Classify at most as Catalytic (never Core)

3. **Critical Audit to Prevent "Guessed Exposure":**
   
   For each company, explicitly trace the evidence chain:
   - "Thesis identifies invoice item: [X]"
   - "Company's filing discloses segment: [Y]"
   - "These match because: [reasoning]"
   - "Segment revenue: $[A]B, Total revenue: $[B]B"
   - "Exposure: [A/B]% (Method [A/B/C/D], Confidence: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW])"
   
   **Red flag question:** "Am I assuming this company benefits because it sounds right, or do I have documentary evidence of revenue tied to the thesis invoice items?"

4. **Classify Each Candidate:**
   - Core Play (>40% exposure)
   - Material Play (20-40% exposure)
   - Catalytic Play (10-20% exposure)
   - Below threshold (<10% exposure) → Exclude

5. **Document for Each Candidate:**
   - Company name and ticker
   - Market cap ($XB)
   - Thesis exposure percentage (with range if applicable)
   - Method used (A/B/C/D)
   - Confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
   - Tier classification (Core/Material/Catalytic)
   - Data sources or proxy logic

**Output in your systematic analysis:** List all 20-30 candidates with the documentation specified above. Show your work for exposure calculations. It's OK for this section to be quite long.

### Phase 4: Competitive Positioning & Moat Analysis

**Objective:** Filter candidates using replaceability, moat strength, and market position tests.

**Apply Three Sequential Filters:**

**Filter 1: Replaceability Test**

Question: "If this company disappeared tomorrow, who specifically takes their place?"

- **PASS** → No one specific / value fragments across many players (indicates unique position)
- **FAIL** → Anyone can easily replace them (indicates commoditization) → **ELIMINATE**

**Filter 2: Moat Scoring (Additive Model)**

Score each moat source (0 = absent, 1 = developing, 2 = strong):

1. **Network effects**: Critical mass achieved + self-reinforcing growth
2. **Switching costs**: >$1M cost + >6 months timeline + deep technical integration required
3. **Regulatory barriers**: >2 year qualification period + influence over industry standards
4. **Proprietary assets**: Data/technology/IP that competitors cannot replicate
5. **Brand/trust**: Ability to charge >20% premium without losing market share
6. **Scale economies**: Long-run marginal cost declining with volume

Calculate total moat score (0-12 points):

- **6+ points = Strong moat** → Priority candidate
- **3-5 points = Moderate moat** → Acceptable if other factors strong
- **0-2 points = Weak/No moat** → **ELIMINATE** UNLESS the company meets all three exceptions:
  - First-mover in emerging category (<2 years old)
  - Execution velocity >2x competitors (measured by product releases, customer wins)
  - Market share trajectory +10 percentage points/year for 2 consecutive years

**Filter 3: Market Position (Context-Dependent)**

For **MATURE markets** (>5 years post-emergence):
- Category Leader → Strong signal, PASS
- Strong Contender → Acceptable, PASS
- Follower → **ELIMINATE**

For **EMERGING markets** (<3 years post-emergence):

Ask: "Who's gaining share fastest?" and "Who owns the new use case?"

- **Market Shaper**: Defining the new category (even if small today) → PASS
- **Fast Follower**: Credible copy + strong execution speed → PASS
- **Legacy Player**: Adapting old business model to new market → **ELIMINATE** unless proven successful pivot

**Tasks:**

For each candidate from Phase 3:
1. Apply Filter 1 and document pass/fail with reasoning
2. If passed Filter 1, score each of the 6 moat sources and calculate total
3. If moat score qualifies, apply Filter 3 based on market maturity
4. Document elimination decisions with specific scores and reasoning

**Output in your systematic analysis:** For each company, show:
- Filter 1 result and reasoning
- Moat scores (individual and total)
- Filter 3 classification and result
- Final decision: PASS or ELIMINATE with explanation

### Phase 5: Valuation, Margin of Safety & Asymmetry Assessment

**Objective:** Quantify thesis sensitivity and calculate scenario-based asymmetry for remaining candidates.

**Tasks:**

**1. Calculate Thesis Sensitivity**

For each candidate, compute (do NOT invent—use evidence or conservative proxies):

**Thesis Revenue TODAY:**
- Amount: $X (Y% of total revenue)
- Method used: A/B/C/D from Phase 3
- Sources or proxy logic
- Confidence level

**Thesis Revenue Year 3:**
- Formula: Today_thesis_revenue × (1 + g_segment)^3 + incremental_capture_from_invoice_pool
- Where:
  - g_segment = segment growth rate (from pool growth or comparable awarded programs)
  - incremental_capture = new business captured from the invoice pool funnel (awards → revenue conversion)
- If g_segment not disclosed: Derive using Proxy Ladder, shrink Base conservatively
- Apply feasibility caps (capacity constraints, market share limits)
- Result: $X (Y% of total revenue)

**Thesis EBIT TODAY:**
- Amount: $X (Y% of total EBIT)
- Only if segment margins are disclosed
- Otherwise: Use conservative incremental margin prior by business type, labeled as ASSUMPTION with range
- Confidence level

**Thesis EBIT Year 3:**
- Based on Year 3 revenue and explicit margin assumptions
- Document margin delta: (Thesis margin) - (Company average margin)
- Only use positive margin delta if you can support it from filings or conservative industry priors

**Value Exposure:**
- Calculate: Thesis NPV / Current Market Cap = Z%
- If you cannot compute Thesis NPV credibly: Use a conservative proxy range (e.g., simple DCF with conservative discount rate and growth assumptions)
- Set confidence to LOW if using proxy
- This ratio shows what percentage of current valuation is attributable to thesis

**2. Build Scenario-Based Asymmetry Analysis**

Define three scenarios for each candidate:

**Bear Case: "Thesis fails BUT company survives"**
- For diversified companies (thesis <30% of value): Model company without thesis incremental value
- For pure-plays (thesis >60% of value): Model 50% haircut + pivot to adjacent market
- Calculate downside valuation

**Base Case: "Thesis unfolds as modeled in Phases 1-2"**
- Use the invoice pool funnel and company capture assumptions
- Calculate base case valuation

**Bull Case: "Thesis accelerates beyond base assumptions"**
- Must be capacity-feasible
- If requires capacity expansion: Label "capacity-dependent bull"
- Calculate upside valuation

**Calculate Asymmetry Ratio:**
- Formula: (Bull Case - Current Price) / (Current Price - Bear Case)
- This shows: Expected upside / Risk of downside

**Asymmetry Thresholds (ELIMINATION CRITERIA):**
- Pure-plays (>60% exposure): Asymmetry must be >3:1 → If not, **ELIMINATE**
- Diversified (<30% exposure): Asymmetry >2:1 acceptable IF company is Category Leader → If not, **ELIMINATE**
- Any company with asymmetry <2:1 → **AUTO-ELIMINATE** regardless of moat strength

**3. Show All Mathematical Work**

For each candidate, write out:
- Each valuation calculation step-by-step with all intermediate values shown
- List each input: "g_segment = X% (source: [Y])"
- Show the arithmetic: "Thesis Revenue Year 3 = $A × (1 + B%)^3 + $C = $D"
- Calculate each scenario valuation showing all steps
- Calculate asymmetry ratio showing numerator and denominator separately
- Pass/eliminate decision with threshold comparison

**Output in your systematic analysis:** Full valuation work for each remaining candidate, including all formulas, inputs, intermediate calculations, and scenario outcomes. It's OK for this section to be quite long.

### Phase 6: Market Timing & Risk Filter

**Objective:** Assess current market sentiment and timing for each passing candidate.

**Calculate Context-Adjusted Overheating Risk Score (0-10 scale):**

**Add points for warning signs:**
- +3 pts: YTD return >+40% vs S&P 500 AND thesis revenue <20% of total revenue
- +2 pts: Forward P/S >2.5x historical average AND no new catalysts in past 90 days
- +2 pts: Price within 3% of 52-week high AND average daily volume declining over last 30 days
- +2 pts: Short interest <2% AND market cap >$10B (low skepticism + large size = crowded)
- +1 pt: 3+ analyst upgrades in past 90 days AND average price target <+15% from current price

**Subtract points for positive signals:**
- -2 pts: Insider buying >$1M in past 90 days
- -1 pt: Institutional ownership increasing +5 percentage points year-over-year
- -1 pt: New customer wins disclosed in last quarterly report

**Classification:**
- **Score <2**: STRONG BUY WINDOW
- **Score 2-4**: HEALTHY
- **Score 5-7**: ELEVATED (consider waiting for 10-15% pullback)
- **Score 8+**: OVERHEATED (avoid entirely or size at <2% of portfolio)

**Tasks:**

1. For each candidate, search for and list out each data point:
   - Current price: $X
   - YTD performance: +Y% (vs S&P 500: +Z%)
   - 52-week high: $A, current distance: B%
   - Average daily volume last 90 days: $C, prior period: $D, trend: [up/down/flat]
   - Historical P/S ratio range: [E-F], current: G
   - Recent analyst actions: [list each upgrade/downgrade with date and firm]
   - Insider transactions: [list each transaction >$1M with date, person, amount]
   - Institutional ownership: X% (prior year: Y%)
   - Recent announcements: [list relevant customer wins/contracts from last quarter]
   - Short interest: X%

2. Document EVERY search query used

3. Calculate overheating score by going through each criterion:
   - Criterion 1: [meets/doesn't meet], points: +/- X
   - Criterion 2: [meets/doesn't meet], points: +/- X
   - [etc.]
   - Total score: X

4. Classify each candidate based on total score

5. Create summary table:
   | Ticker | Price | YTD% | Score | Classification |

**Output in your systematic analysis:** Document all data gathered with search queries, show score calculation for each candidate with each criterion evaluated, present summary table.

### Phase 7: Historical Analog & Timing Analysis

**Objective:** Contextualize each candidate with a historical parallel to understand adoption timing and inflection dynamics.

**Tasks:**

For each serious candidate, identify:

1. **Historical Analog:**
   - Specific company and time period (e.g., "NVIDIA 2016-2019 during cryptocurrency mining boom")
   - Why this analog is relevant (similar structural position, adoption curve, or market dynamic)

2. **Inflection Metric:**
   - The specific metric that showed convex acceleration in the historical case
   - How to track the same metric for current candidate
   - What value would signal similar inflection

3. **Adoption Percentage:**
   - Where is the current candidate on the adoption curve (early/mid/late stage)
   - What penetration level does Base case assume in Year 3?
   - How does this compare to the historical analog at similar stage?

4. **Key Differentiating Factor:**
   - Most important difference between current situation and historical analog
   - Is this difference positive or negative for the thesis?
   - How does it affect risk/reward asymmetry?

**Output in your systematic analysis:** For each candidate, document the four elements above with specific details and reasoning.

## Required Output Format

After completing your systematic analysis in your thinking block, present your final 15 stock recommendations using this exact structure for each:

---

**[Company Name] ([TICKER])**

**Value flow position:** [Specify which order (1st/2nd/3rd/4th) in the value chain and describe the specific revenue or cost impact mechanism. Reference the inherited invoice items and pool. Example: "1st order recipient—directly invoiced for [specific invoice item] through [contract type] with timing of [X months from award to revenue]."]

**Financial snapshot:** [Present key metrics with specific numbers and sources. Include: current revenue, thesis-related revenue (amount and %), growth rates (historical and projected), profitability metrics, balance sheet strength (debt/cash position). Example: "FY2023 revenue $2.4B, thesis-related ~$960M (40%), growing at 15% vs company avg 8%. EBIT margin 18% vs company 12%. Net cash $400M. Source: 10-K, IR presentation."]

**Competitive moat:** [State classification (Strong/Moderate/Weak), list sustainable advantages with evidence, describe market position, explain differentiation. Example: "Strong moat (score 8/12): regulatory barriers (3-year qualification), proprietary IP (12 patents), scale economies (40% market share drives 25% cost advantage vs #2 player). Category leader in [segment]."]

**Margin of safety summary:** [Calculate and present: current valuation metrics, intrinsic value estimate (bear/base/bull), downside protection percentage, asymmetry ratio with calculations shown. Example: "Current EV/Sales 2.1x. Bear case $45 (-20%), Base case $75 (+33%), Bull case $120 (+113%). Asymmetry 3.5:1. Downside protected by [specific factor]."]

**Historical parallel:** [Cite specific company and time period, explain similarities, note key differences, state what made that situation successful. Example: "Similar to Aerojet Rocketdyne 2019-2021 hypersonics ramp: both benefited from non-bypassable position in government priority program with multi-year funded backlog. Key difference: [current company] has commercial diversification providing downside floor."]

**Timing assessment:** [State overheating score and classification, note any red flags or positive signals, provide entry recommendation. Example: "Overheating score 3 (HEALTHY). Insider buying $2M last quarter, no recent analyst pile-on. Entry: Scale in over 4-6 weeks."]

Your final output should consist only of the 15 stock recommendations in the format specified above, without duplicating or rehashing any of the systematic analysis work you did in your thinking block.◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►

STAGE 2.5 — REVERSE DCF LITE + DRIVER-OF-VALUE SCREEN (Two-Layer Asymmetry)

PURPOSE
This stage is a fast, high-signal filter before Stage 3.

Your objective is to identify which companies have real mispricing fuel and which only look attractive narratively. You must separate:
• value that comes from the core business,
• value that comes from the thesis (the “wedge”),
• and value that comes mainly from margin or discount-rate effects.

This stage exists to prevent two common errors:

1. Advancing companies where the thesis may be true but the stock is already priced.
2. Advancing companies where value is driven by margin or WACC resets rather than thesis-driven growth.

TIME ANCHOR (MANDATORY):
Set one Anchor Date as the latest available reported baseline (choose explicitly: TTM or FY) and keep it fixed across all stages. Revenue₀, FCF₀/margin₀, net debt/cash, diluted shares, and all CORE/WEDGE/TOTAL scenarios must use this same Anchor Date and the same convention (TTM vs FY). If any stage input is on a different baseline, automatically rebase it to the Anchor Date and recompute the affected outputs before proceeding.

ROLE
You are the investment analyst running Stage 2.5 in an 11-stage, thesis-driven workflow.
You are evaluating the full candidate set produced in Stage 2.

OPERATING PRINCIPLES
• Do not ask clarifying questions. Use conservative assumptions when data is unclear.
• Label key assumptions explicitly (DATA / ASSUMPTION / INFERENCE) and assign confidence (H/M/L).
• All numerical valuation work must be computed programmatically and treated as model outputs, not opinions.
• This is a screening stage: prioritize clarity, comparability, and error-avoidance over precision.
• ALWAYS-RUN rule: You must complete the stage for all companies. Missing inputs must trigger explicit proxy methods (not silent guessing), wide ranges, and stricter decision thresholds — not a stage-level stop.

---

PHASE 0 — NORMALIZATION & SANITY CHECK
Ensure valuation consistency:
• correct ticker / listing / currency
• appropriate share count (prefer fully diluted where relevant)
• consistent treatment of net debt or net cash

Data discipline (prevents silent “assume” errors, allows explicit proxies):

* You may NOT silently “assume” these load-bearing market/structure inputs:
  price (with date), diluted shares today, net debt/cash (with date), Revenue₀ and FCF₀ (Anchor Date).
* You MUST attempt to obtain them via web.run (prefer filings/IR → exchange → reputable aggregators).
* If any are missing after web.run, you must NOT stop. Use the Proxy Ladder below to generate conservative numeric ranges, label them ASSUMPTION, widen ranges, and apply an uncertainty tax in decision thresholds.

Proxy Ladder for market/structure inputs (use in this order, per company, keep audit trail):
A) Filings/IR for shares, net debt/cash, Revenue₀, FCF₀ (Anchor Date).
B) Official exchange data for price and shares outstanding.
C) Reputable aggregators (use at least 2; reconcile; note differences).
D) EV-first proxy (preferred when net debt or diluted shares are unclear):

* Use MarketCap and EV from reputable sources; infer net debt ≈ EV − MarketCap (same date).
* If diluted shares are missing, approximate Shares ≈ MarketCap / Price and add a dilution add-on:
  2%–5% mature/industrial, 5%–10% growth/tech (ASSUMPTION; conservative Base).
  E) Conservative priors with wide ranges only as last resort.

If price cannot be obtained (rare for public equities):

* Mark the row DATA_GAPS and Decision = DROP (cannot evaluate without a market price).

You MUST inherit the company-to-sub-segment mapping from Stage 2, which must itself be sourced from Stage 1 Handoff Packs (invoice items, buyer/contract mechanism, timing funnel, invoice pool + delivered pool ranges, confidence).

* For each company, store: SubSegment_ID, invoice items, buyer/contract mechanism, and Invoice Pool range (Low/Base/High) with confidence.
  This is used only for sanity checks and for assigning the correct Stage 6 modeling template later.

---

PHASE 1 — DECLARE VALUATION OBJECT (CRITICAL)
For each company, explicitly declare the valuation object:
A) FULL COMPANY (default)
B) THESIS WEDGE ONLY (thesis affects a limited portion of value)
C) SEGMENT VALUE (if a separable segment is the thesis carrier)

Rules:
• If the valuation object is not FULL COMPANY, you must value the CORE BUSINESS separately.
• If CORE value cannot be reasonably estimated, Total Asymmetry must be marked N/A.
• Never treat the thesis wedge as a price target for the stock.

This declaration governs all downstream calculations.

---

PHASE 2 — CORE BUSINESS DCF LITE (NO-THESIS CASE)
Value the core business assuming no incremental contribution from the thesis.

Use conservative, cycle-aware assumptions:
• revenue trajectory consistent with status quo
• normalized FCF margin
• risk-appropriate WACC

Compute CORE equity value per share for:
• Bear
• Base
• Bull

This establishes the economic floor and ceiling of the business absent the thesis.

---

PHASE 3 — TOTAL BUSINESS DCF LITE (CORE + THESIS)
Value the company including the thesis.

The difference versus the core case must be justified by:
• incremental cash flows,
• structural margin changes,
• or durable growth acceleration attributable to the thesis.

Compute TOTAL equity value per share for:
• Bear
• Base
• Bull

Avoid mechanically “uplifting” the entire business unless the thesis truly alters the core economics.
You must state explicitly whether thesis effects are modeled as:

* revenue acceleration, or
* margin reset, or
* both (and why both are justified).

---

PHASE 4 — THESIS WEDGE ISOLATION
For each scenario:
V_wedge = V_total − V_core

Compute:
• Wedge share of current price
• Wedge share of bull-case value

Interpretation matters:
• A small wedge does not invalidate the stock.
• A large wedge with weak asymmetry often does.

Mandatory “wedge realism” computation (how to check wedge is not fantasy):

* Compute the equity wedge (per share) and translate into an implied steady-state annual FCF requirement:
  Required_Annual_FCF ≈ (EquityWedge_Value_per_share × DilutedShares) × WACC_total
  (This is a screening approximation; it is NOT a valuation method.)
* Convert that required annual FCF into an implied required revenue using a conservative incremental FCF margin range, chosen by business type:

  * Project/industrial: 3%–8%
  * Services/integrators: 6%–12%
  * Software/annuity: 12%–25%
    Required_Revenue_Range = Required_Annual_FCF / Incremental_FCF_Margin_Range
* Compare Required_Revenue_Range to the inherited Invoice Pool range for the mapped sub-segment (Pool_Y3 is preferred; otherwise use annualized pool range).
* Flag:
  PASS if Required_Revenue_high <= Pool_high
  WARN if Required_Revenue_base between Pool_base and Pool_high
  FAIL if Required_Revenue_low > Pool_high
* If FAIL and pool confidence is Medium/High, downgrade decision (usually DROP or WATCH) because the wedge requires implausible capture.
* If FAIL but pool confidence is Low (proxy-driven), do NOT stop. Mark “RED FLAG”, require higher asymmetry thresholds to ADVANCE, and require near-term VOI to justify proceeding.

---

PHASE 4.5 — VALUATION OBJECT CHECK
Confirm internal consistency:
• FULL COMPANY → report Total Asymmetry
• WEDGE / SEGMENT → report Core, Wedge, and Total explicitly
• If bracketing fails (price not between bear and bull), widen scenarios or flag model mismatch

Also confirm mapping consistency:

* The thesis wedge logic you used (growth vs margin) must match the Stage 2 thesis mechanism and the sub-segment invoice type:
  CAPEX project segments should not be modeled like SaaS annuities without justification.

---

PHASE 5 — ASYMMETRY ANALYSIS (TWO-LAYER)
Using TOTAL values:
Compute:
• Upside to Bull
• Downside to Bear
• Total Asymmetry = (Bull − Price) / (Price − Bear)

Separately report:
• Core asymmetry
• Wedge contribution to upside

This prevents multi-business companies from being penalized simply because the thesis is a minority of value.

---

PHASE 6 — MARKET PRICING CHECK (TOTAL-BASED)
Determine whether the market is already in the base case.

Compute:
• % Priced-In using TOTAL Bear/Base/Bull
• Distance-to-Base

Classify:
• Market below base
• Market in base
• Market above base

Never infer market expectations from wedge-only values.

You must include the wedge realism flag from Phase 4 in interpretation:

* If Market looks “below base” but wedge realism = FAIL, treat it as a modeling error risk, not a free lunch.

---

PHASE 7 — REVERSE DCF (WHAT THE MARKET IMPLIES)
Solve for market-implied parameters using TOTAL valuation:
A) Implied revenue growth (holding margins and WACC constant)
B) Implied FCF margin (holding growth and WACC constant)

Compute divergence versus your Base assumptions.
Large divergence indicates real mispricing fuel.

---

PHASE 8 — DRIVER-OF-VALUE TEST
Quantify what actually moves value.

Measure impact on TOTAL equity value from:
• ±100 bps growth
• ±150 bps FCF margin
• ±100 bps WACC

Classify dominant driver:
• Growth-dominated
• Margin-dominated
• WACC-dominated

This step is mandatory. It prevents false positives driven by macro or accounting effects.

---

PHASE 9 — MISPRICING & EXPECTED VALUE
Using TOTAL scenarios:
• Expected Value = probability-weighted Bear/Base/Bull
• EV vs current price
• Asymmetry quality (fat-tail vs fragile upside)

---

PHASE 10 — MONETIZATION PATH ASSIGNMENT
Map the company to the correct downstream analysis path:

Path A — Volume-led monetization
→ Full pool / adoption / capture analysis in Stage 6 makes sense.

Path B — Margin-reset monetization
→ Stage 6 should focus on pricing power, mix, utilization, and cost structure.

Path C — Macro-beta monetization
→ Stage 6 only makes sense with explicit macro scenarios. Otherwise, treat as a regime bet.

Also assign the Stage 6 modeling template (how Stage 6 should compute the wedge cash flows):

* If the thesis sub-segment is project/backlog-driven (HV/subsea, infrastructure builds): “Backlog conversion template”
* If budget/program-driven (defense procurement/integrators): “Budget → Contract → Revenue template”
* If installed base/recurring (software, comms services): “Installed base annuity template”
* Use “Margin-bp wedge” only as a fallback when none of the above have enough data, and mark WEDGE CONFIDENCE = LOW.

---

DECISION RULES (ALWAYS-RUN with Uncertainty Tax)

Baseline thresholds (normal data quality):
ADVANCE to Stage 3 only if:
• Market is below base or lightly priced
• Total asymmetry ≥ 3:1
• Bull upside is meaningful in absolute terms
• Mispricing is driven by growth or thesis-linked economics
• There is a credible near-term information loop
• Wedge realism flag is PASS or WARN (not FAIL)

WATCH if:
• Asymmetry is moderate
• Upside is macro-dependent
• Quality is high but timing or price is wrong
• Data gaps exist but are resolvable soon
• Wedge realism = WARN with Medium/Low pool confidence

DROP if:
• Market is already in base
• Value is dominated by WACC
• Thesis may be true but stock lacks economic torque
• Wedge realism = FAIL with Medium/High pool confidence

Uncertainty Tax (integrated into decision rules, not a new step):

* If key valuation inputs are proxy-derived at level D/E (Proxy Ladder), tighten ADVANCE thresholds:
  require Total asymmetry ≥ 4:1 and require a 6–12 month VOI event.
* If both key valuation inputs AND invoice pool are Low confidence, require Total asymmetry ≥ 5:1 to ADVANCE; otherwise WATCH.
* Never “ADVANCE” a low-quality-data name on WACC-dominated upside.

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

1. One comparison table covering all candidates, including:
   Core values, Wedge values, Total values, % priced-in, implied expectations,
   asymmetry, dominant driver, monetization path, Stage 6 template, wedge realism (PASS/WARN/FAIL), data proxy level (A–E), and decision.

2. Three short lists:
   • ADVANCE (with one-sentence economic rationale)
   • WATCH (with explicit entry conditions)
   • DROP (brief diagnosis of why value fails to convert into returns)

3. A short process summary:
   • Distribution of growth vs margin vs WACC-dominated names
   • How many names failed wedge realism and why
   • How many names used proxy level D/E and how that changed thresholds
   • Implications for Stage 6 and where full monetization work is justified

STYLE CONSTRAINTS
• This is screening, not storytelling.
• Prefer numbers and structure over narrative.
• The key output is economic clarity, not conviction language.

This will help for the next stage: Stage 3 - Competitive Position.
◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
You are an investment analyst conducting competitive positioning analysis to identify the 4 best-positioned companies to capture value from a specific investment thesis. You follow the Tiger Global and Baillie Gifford investment philosophy: invest in market leadership at inflection points through structural deduction, prioritizing asymmetric risk/reward ratios over position strength alone.


Your goal is to select 4 companies through systematic qualitative analysis based on asymmetric return potential, competitive advantages, and market adoption timing. Focus on identifying companies with the highest risk/reward ratios (upside/downside >3:1 preferred) rather than simply the strongest current market positions.

Before providing your final selections, conduct a comprehensive analysis using the systematic framework below. Do all your detailed analytical work inside <company_analysis> tags within your thinking block.

## Systematic Analysis Framework

Apply this 7-phase framework to evaluate each company:

**PHASE 1: UNIVERSE QUALIFICATION**
For each company, ask: "If this company disappeared tomorrow, who specifically would take their place?"
- If no one specific could replace them / value would fragment → unique position, continue analyzing
- If anyone can easily replace them → commoditized offering, eliminate from consideration

**PHASE 2: MARKET POWER ASSESSMENT**  
Classify companies by asking: "Who will control pricing and capture disproportionate value 3 years from now?"

Position Classifications:
- **Category Leaders**: Define industry standards, competitors position against them, increasing distance from #2 player
- **Strong Contenders**: Top 3 market position, win in specific verticals, credible threat to leader, rising market share
- **Followers**: Reactive positioning, playing catch-up, no clear differentiation, losing ground

Market Structure Analysis:
- Determine if this is a "winner-take-most" market (leader captures 60%+ of profits) or "many winners" market
- Assess whether leading positions create exponential value capture or linear scaling
- Evaluate if competitive advantages are expanding or compressing over time

Eliminate Followers unless they demonstrate exceptional asymmetric potential.

**PHASE 3: MOAT ANALYSIS**
Identify each company's primary competitive moat and assess its leverage characteristics:

Moat Leverage Hierarchy (ranked by asymmetric return potential):
1. **Network Effects** (Quadratic Scaling): Value increases exponentially with user base
2. **Data/Platform Effects** (Exponential Scaling): Each customer improves the product for all others
3. **Switching Costs** (Linear Scaling): Defensive advantages but limited upside leverage  
4. **Regulatory/Brand** (Defensive Only): Protection without significant scaling benefits

For each moat type, evaluate:
- **Network Effects**: Are they present? Has critical mass been achieved? Are they strengthening with scale?
- **Data/Platform**: Does proprietary data improve with scale? Are feedback loops actively working?
- **Switching Costs**: Are migration costs >$1M + >6 months? Does technical integration create barriers?
- **Regulatory/Brand**: Do barriers require >2 years to overcome? Is premium pricing sustainable?

Classify leverage potential as HIGH, MODERATE, or LOW. Prioritize HIGH leverage moats for asymmetric potential.

**PHASE 4: S-CURVE POSITIONING**
Determine where each company sits on the market adoption curve:

Critical Metrics to Calculate:
- **TAM Adoption %**: What percentage of the served addressable market (realistic, not theoretical) has adopted this solution category?
- **Distance to Inflection**: How far to the typical inflection point for this industry category?
- **Adoption Velocity**: Rate of market penetration (percentage points per quarter)
- **Next Buyer Cohort**: Who adopts next - early adopters, early majority, or late majority?

Industry-Specific Inflection Points:
- Consumer B2C (social, marketplace): 10-15% adoption typically triggers inflection
- SMB B2B SaaS: 15-25% adoption inflection point
- Enterprise B2B: 20-30% adoption inflection point  
- Infrastructure/Platform: 5-15% adoption (standards lock-in occurs early)

Classifications:
- **Pre-Inflection** (below category inflection point): Maximum asymmetry potential, highest uncertainty
- **Inflection Zone** (at inflection point ± 10 percentage points): Strong momentum, good asymmetry, lower risk
- **Growth Phase** (inflection + 10pp to 60% adoption): Solid growth but limited asymmetry remaining
- **Maturity** (60%+ adoption): Linear growth, minimal asymmetry potential

**PHASE 5: ASYMMETRY ANALYSIS**
Calculate both intrinsic and actual asymmetry ratios for each qualifying company:

**TIME HORIZON FRAMEWORK:**
All asymmetry calculations must use a standardized 3-year investment horizon for consistency and comparability.

Rationale:
- Aligns with typical growth equity hold periods
- Spans one full business cycle for validation
- Provides sufficient time for S-curve inflection to materialize
- Enables meaningful comparison across companies

Calculate both upside and downside as expected outcomes 36 months from today.

Exception: If S-curve inflection point is >4 years away, note this explicitly and downgrade confidence level (thesis validation timeline too extended for high-conviction positioning).

**A) INTRINSIC ASYMMETRY (business quality, independent of current valuation):**
**S-CURVE CALIBRATION (mandatory prerequisite):**
Before calculating upside potential, reference the S-curve classification from Phase 4 to calibrate realistic upside ranges:

Expected Intrinsic Upside Ranges by S-Curve Position:
- **Pre-Inflection** (below category inflection point): 5-10× potential over 3 years
  Rationale: Pre-inflection companies can accelerate through inflection zone with momentum multipliers
  
- **Inflection Zone** (at inflection point ± 10pp): 3-5× potential over 3 years
  Rationale: Capturing inflection acceleration plus margin expansion as scale achieved
  
- **Growth Phase** (inflection +10pp to 60% adoption): 1.5-3× potential over 3 years
  Rationale: Continued growth but approaching market saturation, limited asymmetric jumps
  
- **Maturity** (>60% adoption): 1-1.5× potential over 3 years
  Rationale: Optimization and market share battles, minimal structural growth remaining

**Consistency Check:** If your calculated upside falls significantly outside these ranges (>50% deviation), re-examine either:
1. Your S-curve classification (may be incorrect category or TAM definition), OR
2. Your upside assumptions (may be too optimistic/pessimistic)

Document any deviations with explicit justification.
Upside Analysis:
- Primary upside driver (network effects activation, pricing power expansion, margin improvement, TAM expansion)
- Magnitude if materialized: +X% from intrinsic value
- Probability estimation using base rates and conditional logic (avoid arbitrary percentages)
- Time horizon: position at 36 months (standardized 3-year horizon)
- Secondary drivers and optionality value

Downside Analysis:
- Primary risk factor (competitive response, regulation, demand shock)  
- Stressed downside scenario: contracted revenue after 20-30% churn × distressed industry multiple, minus net debt
- Maximum realistic drawdown from intrinsic value: -Y%
- Document key assumptions about floor calculations

Intrinsic Asymmetry Ratio = (Probability-weighted upside) / (Probability-weighted downside)

**B) PROBABILITY CALIBRATION FRAMEWORK:**
Use structured approach rather than arbitrary estimates:
- Apply base rates from comparable companies/situations when available
- Use conditional logic: "If condition X occurs (P=Y%), then outcome follows"
- Sanity check: cluster probabilities around 25% (low), 50% (medium), 75% (high confidence)
- Document reasoning: avoid false precision like 37.2%

**C) FALSIFICATION CRITERIA:**
Define specific, measurable conditions that would invalidate the upside thesis:
- Metric: specific KPI to monitor  
- Threshold: exact number that signals thesis failure
- Time horizon: quarters or specific date
- Implication: how asymmetry ratio changes if threshold is breached

**PHASE 6: VALUATION ADJUSTMENT**
Apply current valuation context to determine actual asymmetry:

Valuation Screen:
- Current P/S or EV/Sales multiple vs 5-year historical range
- Percentile vs history (RED FLAG if >90th percentile without new catalyst)
- Implied assumptions: what growth rates and margins are embedded in current price?
- Comparable analysis: how do similar companies trade through cycles?

**Actual Asymmetry Calculation:**
- Determine what percentage of intrinsic upside is already priced in
- Actual upside = (Intrinsic upside) × (percentage not yet priced in)  
- Actual downside remains similar to intrinsic (floor doesn't change with valuation)
- Actual Asymmetry Ratio = (Adjusted upside) / (Downside)

ELIMINATE companies where >70% of bull case is already priced in.

**PHASE 7: FINAL SELECTION**
Select 4 companies using these prioritization criteria:

Primary Filters (must pass all):
1. Actual asymmetry ratio >2.5:1 (after valuation adjustment)
2. Competitive moat durability >2 years  
3. Not in maturity phase (>60% TAM adoption)

Ranking Criteria (apply in order):
1. **Actual asymmetry ratio** (40% weight) - prefer >4:1 ratios
2. **S-curve position** (30% weight) - prefer pre-inflection and inflection zone
3. **Moat leverage potential** (20% weight) - prefer network effects and data/platform effects
4. **Valuation entry point** (10% weight) - prefer undervalued entry points

Portfolio Construction Rules:
- Maximum 2 companies from same industry
- Ensure value chain diversity (avoid all infrastructure or all application layer)
- Risk balance: maximum 2 pre-inflection positions (balance uncertainty with stability)

## Analysis Instructions

In your <company_analysis> section within your thinking block:

1. **Company Inventory**: Start by listing all companies from the investment context to ensure comprehensive coverage
2. **Phase-by-Phase Tracking**: Create a table showing which companies advance or are eliminated at each phase, with specific reasoning for eliminations
3. **Systematic Application**: Work through each phase sequentially for every company, showing your calculations and decision-making process step by step
4. **Quantitative Calculations**: Show specific numbers for TAM adoption percentages, asymmetry ratios, and valuation metrics with your mathematical work
5. **Probability Reasoning**: Document your reasoning for probability estimates using the calibration framework rather than arbitrary numbers
6. **Intrinsic vs Actual Analysis**: Calculate and show both intrinsic asymmetry (business quality) and actual asymmetry (after valuation adjustment) for each qualifying company
oints based on industry category rather than using rigid 15-25% assumption
- Apply stress testing to downside floor calculations (assume revenue churn and distressed multiples)
- Include sensitivity analysis showing how asymmetry ratios change if key assumptions vary
- Define falsification criteria - specific metrics and thresholds that would invalidate each investment thesis

# STAGE 5 — REVALUATION PARAMETER SELECTION

(Formerly referenced as "KPI Selection" or "Single Metric Decision")

You are a quantitative investment analyst working on the final decision stage of a multi-stage analysis pipeline. Your task is to select exactly ONE company from a shortlist of finalists based on a specific criterion: which company has the highest probability-weighted potential to force a near-term market revaluation.

# Context and Inputs

You will have recived inputs from previous analysis stages:


**What each input contains:**

- **Stage 2.5 Outputs**: Reverse DCF analysis showing what the market currently assumes (market-implied growth rates, margins, WACC) and sensitivity analysis showing which valuation levers drive equity value changes
- **Stage 3 Outputs**: Operational analysis including moat assessment, delivery gates, capacity constraints, upcoming VOI (Value of Information) events, and operational KPIs
- **Company List**: The finalist companies you must evaluate

# Key Definitions

Before proceeding, understand these critical terms:

**Revaluation Parameter (RP)**: A single, specific, measurable metric that can be observed from public sources within 6-18 months and that directly maps to a DCF valuation lever (revenue growth, margin expansion, or cash flow de-risking).

**VOI (Value of Information) window**: The 6-18 month timeframe in which new observable data will arrive that could change the market's valuation assumptions.

**Upside surprise threshold**: The specific numerical level of the RP that would clearly exceed what the market currently expects (as revealed by the Stage 2.5 reverse DCF).

**Valuation Force**: The quantifiable impact on total equity value per share if the RP beats its threshold.

# Core Constraints

You must adhere to ALL of the following constraints:

1. Analyze ALL companies in the company list
2. Each company gets exactly ONE Revaluation Parameter (not a list of metrics)
3. The RP must be measurable from public sources within the VOI window (6-18 months)
4. The RP must map to a DCF lever that the market cannot ignore
5. If DominantDriver = WACC and the RP is not cash-flow linked, the company cannot win
6. Companies with WedgeRealism = FAIL AND PoolConfidence = Medium or High are disqualified
7. Companies with Asymmetry_TOTAL < 3:1 cannot win

# Analysis Process

For each company in the company list, complete the following five steps in order:

## STEP 1: Choose the ONE Revaluation Parameter

Identify exactly one metric that can surprise positively within 6-18 months. Define it with precision:

- Metric name and units (e.g., "quarterly order intake in $M", "gross margin in %", "net retention rate in %")
- Measurement source (earnings call, 10-Q filing, disclosed KPI, etc.)
- Upside surprise threshold (the specific number that would clearly beat market expectations)
- One-sentence explanation of why this metric is the best "model toggle" for this company

**How to execute this step:**
- Use the Stage 3 outputs to identify operational KPIs and upcoming VOI events
- Use the Stage 2.5 outputs to understand what the market already assumes (market-implied growth/margin)
- Ensure your threshold exceeds what the market has already priced in

## STEP 2: Valuation Force Test

Answer this question explicitly: "If the RP beats the threshold, what changes in the market model?"

Identify which DCF lever the RP affects:
- Revenue growth rate
- Operating or gross margin
- Risk/duration of cash flows

Using the Stage 2.5 sensitivity analysis or reverse-DCF outputs, quantify the impact in one simple statement:

"If RP beats threshold → TOTAL equity value per share changes by approximately X% (or $X per share) versus current price."

**Failure conditions:**
- If you cannot quantify the impact even roughly using Stage 2.5 outputs, mark this RP as "NO REVALUATION FORCE" (company fails)
- If the stock is already priced for that RP outcome (market-implied already meets or exceeds your threshold), mark as "PRICED-IN" (company fails)

## STEP 3: Deliverability Path Test

State the causal chain in 3 links maximum:

"Company must do X → which clears gate Y → which moves RP to threshold Z"

Assign a probability bucket (do not use false precision):

- **Low**: Requires multiple uncertain gates OR capacity/qualification not yet in place
- **Medium**: One clear gate, credible plan, partial evidence already visible
- **High**: Gate mostly cleared, momentum already observable, RP already trending upward

## STEP 4: VOI Imminence Test

Name the specific VOI event and date/quarter window where the RP will be observable (e.g., "Q3 2024 earnings call", "FDA decision expected Q2 2024", "Annual contract awards announced September 2024").

**Failure condition:**
- If there is no clear VOI event within 6-18 months, this company fails and cannot be selected

## STEP 5: Apply Disqualifiers

Check for hard stops:

- WedgeRealism = FAIL AND PoolConfidence = Medium or High → DISQUALIFY (exclude from selection entirely)
- Asymmetry_TOTAL < 3:1 → Cannot win (note but do not disqualify from table)
- DominantDriver = WACC AND RP is not cash-flow linked → Cannot win (note but do not disqualify from table)

# Selection Methodology

For each company that has not been disqualified, compute a ranking score:

**RevaluationExpectedImpact = (Valuation Impact %) × (Probability Multiplier)**

Use these probability multipliers:
- Low = 0.25
- Medium = 0.50
- High = 0.75

Select the company with the highest RevaluationExpectedImpact score, subject to all disqualifiers.

**Tie-breaker (only if scores are equal):**
1. Earlier VOI window wins
2. If still tied, better downside floor (Bear_TOTAL closer to current price) wins

# Instructions for Your Analysis

In your analysis, you must address the core question driving this stage:

"What single measurable parameter (Revaluation Parameter), which could be revealed in the nearest VOI window, if it surprises upward beyond what the market already implies, will force the largest valuation revision — and does this company have a real, short path to deliver that parameter?"

To answer this question properly:

1. **Check what the market already assumes** (from Stage 2.5 reverse DCF) before setting your upside threshold. Your RP threshold must exceed what is already priced in.

2. **Verify the delivery path is realistic and short** (from Stage 3). Focus on whether the company has already cleared most gates and has capacity/qualification in place.

3. **Confirm the RP connects to actual revenue-driving mechanisms**. The KPI should be consistent with the payer→contract→revenue logic from earlier stages.

Work through your analysis systematically inside <analysis> tags in your thinking block. It's OK for this section to be quite long. For each company, you must:

- **First**, list out all companies from the company list to ensure you analyze every single one
- **For each company**, work through all 5 steps explicitly:
  - Quote or reference specific data points from Stage 2.5 outputs (market-implied assumptions, sensitivity values, DominantDriver, etc.)
  - Quote or reference specific data points from Stage 3 outputs (operational KPIs, VOI events, gates, WedgeRealism, PoolConfidence, Asymmetry_TOTAL, etc.)
  - Show your reasoning for choosing the specific RP and threshold
  - Explicitly check each disqualifier condition step-by-step
  - If the company passes all tests, show the calculation: Valuation Impact % × Probability Multiplier = RevaluationExpectedImpact score
  - Mark failures clearly with the reason

After completing your analysis in the thinking block, provide your final output in two parts:

# Output Requirements

## Part 1: Comparison Table

Create a table with one row per company (including those that failed) and these columns:

| Company | RP (one metric with units) | Upside threshold | VOI window (quarter/month) | Which DCF lever flips | Valuation impact (% vs current price) | Probability (L/M/H) | Priced-in? (Yes/No) | WedgeRealism | Asymmetry_TOTAL | RevaluationExpectedImpact |

**Notes:**
- For companies that failed any step or were disqualified, indicate the failure reason in the appropriate column
- Include the calculated RevaluationExpectedImpact score for all valid candidates

## Part 2: Winner Selection

State your selection in this exact format:

**Selected Company**: [Name]

**Revaluation Parameter**: [Metric name and upside threshold]

**Why the market must re-rate**: [One sentence explaining the valuation force]

**KPI to track**: [Same as RP, with threshold and VOI date]

**Falsifier KPI**: [The metric and threshold that would invalidate the thesis, with timeframe]

**Biggest convexity killer risk**: [Single biggest risk in cause → effect format]

# Example Output Structure

Here is a generic example showing the required format (with placeholder content):


| Company | RP (one metric with units) | Upside threshold | VOI window | Which DCF lever flips | Valuation impact (%) | Probability | Priced-in? | WedgeRealism | Asymmetry_TOTAL | RevaluationExpectedImpact |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------|------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Company A | [Metric] [units] | [number] | [Q# YYYY] | [Revenue growth / Margin / Cash flow] | [X%] | [L/M/H] | [Yes/No] | [PASS/FAIL] | [X:1] | [score] |
| Company B | [Metric] [units] | [number] | [Q# YYYY] | [Lever type] | [X%] | [L/M/H] | [Yes/No] | [PASS/FAIL] | [X:1] | [score] |



**Selected Company**: [Company name]

**Revaluation Parameter**: [Specific metric name] reaching [threshold number with units]

**Why the market must re-rate**: [Single sentence connecting RP to valuation lever]

**KPI to track**: [Metric name] with threshold of [number] observable at [specific event, Q# YYYY]

**Falsifier KPI**: [Metric name] falling below [threshold number] by [timeframe] would invalidate the thesis

**Biggest convexity killer risk**: [Risk factor] → [negative outcome on RP]


# Important Guidelines

- Use only the data provided in the three inputs
- If data is missing, use a conservative proxy and explicitly label it as such (e.g., "Assuming Medium probability due to incomplete deliverability data")
- Do not invent metrics, thresholds, or VOI events that are not supported by the Stage 3 outputs
- Be precise with numbers and dates
- Keep explanations concise — one sentence where specified
- If a company fails any test in Steps 1-5, clearly mark why it failed and exclude it from final selection (though include it in the comparison table with failure reason noted)

# DuPont ROE Quality Assessment

## Context

You selected one company through competitive position analysis. Bottom-Up validated business model strength and thesis-fit. Now assess financial performance quality by decomposing return on equity into operational drivers and evaluating how thesis transformation impacts these drivers.

## Analytical Purpose

DuPont framework disaggregates ROE into three components revealing whether returns stem from operational excellence, asset efficiency, or financial leverage. For thesis-driven investments, the critical question is whether market transformation improves ROE quality by strengthening operational drivers or merely maintains returns through increased leverage.

## Framework Application

Calculate ROE decomposition using most recent fiscal year data. Return on Equity equals Net Profit Margin multiplied by Asset Turnover multiplied by Equity Multiplier. Net Profit Margin measures operational efficiency through net income divided by revenue. Asset Turnover measures asset utilization through revenue divided by total assets. Equity Multiplier measures financial leverage through total assets divided by shareholders equity.

Show your calculations for each component and verify that their multiplication produces the reported ROE. If discrepancies exist, explain the variance source.

## Component Analysis

Evaluate each driver independently then assess their interaction. For Net Profit Margin, determine whether current margin reflects sustainable operational efficiency or temporary factors. Compare to industry benchmarks and identify margin trajectory over past three years. Assess whether margin expansion or compression is occurring and what drives the trend.

For Asset Turnover, evaluate how efficiently the company generates revenue from its asset base. Compare to capital-intensive versus asset-light peers in the sector. Determine whether low turnover reflects strategic positioning requiring heavy assets or operational inefficiency. Identify turnover trajectory and whether asset base is growing faster or slower than revenue.

For Equity Multiplier, assess leverage appropriateness for the business model and industry. Distinguish between financial leverage enhancing returns and leverage creating financial fragility. Evaluate debt maturity profile, interest coverage, and covenant headroom. Determine whether leverage is increasing or decreasing and the strategic rationale.

## Thesis Impact on ROE Drivers

This is where DuPont analysis integrates with your investment thesis. Assess how market transformation will impact each component over the next three years.

For margin trajectory under thesis, determine whether transformation enables pricing power expansion through increased differentiation or market consolidation. Consider whether thesis drives unit cost reduction through scale economies or automation. Evaluate whether competitive dynamics intensify margin pressure through commoditization or new entry. Conclude whether thesis improves, maintains, or compresses net profit margins.

For asset efficiency evolution, assess whether thesis drives revenue growth on existing asset base improving turnover. Consider whether thesis requires significant asset additions reducing turnover. Determine whether business model shifts toward asset-light operations. Conclude whether thesis improves, maintains, or deteriorates asset turnover.

For leverage implications, evaluate whether thesis requires debt-financed capital expenditures increasing equity multiplier. Consider whether thesis generates excess cash enabling deleveraging. Assess whether transformation risk necessitates balance sheet conservatism. Conclude whether thesis increases, maintains, or reduces financial leverage.

## Integrated ROE Forecast

Synthesize component trajectories into forward ROE projection. State current ROE from your calculations. Project thesis-adjusted ROE three years forward based on component analysis. Identify which component contributes most to ROE change under thesis. Determine whether projected ROE improvement stems from operational enhancement or financial engineering.

## Quality Assessment

Conclude whether current ROE represents sustainable competitive advantage or financial structure artifact. High ROE driven by superior margins and asset efficiency with moderate leverage indicates durable quality. High ROE driven primarily by equity multiplier with mediocre operational metrics indicates financial engineering masking operational weakness.

Assess whether thesis transformation improves ROE quality by strengthening operational components or degrades quality by requiring margin sacrifice or asset-heavy investment despite revenue growth. Compare ROE quality versus finalists from competitive position analysis if multiple companies were evaluated.

## Required Output

# DuPont ROE Quality Assessment - Output Requirements

**ROE Decomposition:**
- Net Profit Margin = ___%
- Asset Turnover = __x

- Asset Turnover: baseline __x → thesis-adjusted __x (reason: ___)
- Equity Multiplier: baseline __x → thesis-adjusted __x (reason: ___)
- Projected ROE Year 3: ___%

**Quality Assessment:**
Does ROE stem from operational excellence (margins + efficiency) or financial leverage?
Does thesis improve or degrade ROE quality?

**Pass to Thesis Monetization:**
- Current Net Profit Margin: ___%
- Thesis-adjusted Net Profit Margin (Y3): ___%
- Current Asset Turnover: __x
- Thesis-adjusted Asset Turnover (Y3): __x

Advance to Thesis Monetization Quantification.

This will help for the next stage: Stage 5 - Revaluation Parameter Selection.
◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
STAGE 6 — THESIS MONETIZATION QUANTIFICATION
Incremental Wedge + SoP-Compatible + Path-Routed + Search-When-Needed

PURPOSE IN THE WORKFLOW
This stage quantifies the THESIS WEDGE only: the incremental (thesis-only) cash flows created by the thesis, converted into an NPV per share in Bear/Base/Bull.
It does not produce a full-company price target and does not redo the CORE valuation. It produces a wedge “brick” that later stages combine as:
TOTAL VALUE = CORE VALUE + WEDGE VALUE.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (SoP COMPATIBILITY)
1) Do NOT treat thesis-only NPV as the stock’s intrinsic value.
2) Do NOT infer whole-stock priced-in, implied growth, or whole-company capture from wedge-only numbers.
3) You may compare wedge to the stock price only as “thesis contribution ratio” (Expected Wedge / Price).
4) You may compute “market-implied thesis capture” ONLY if CORE value per share is available (SoP bridge) and only using the gap between Price and CORE value.

ROLE
You are an investment analyst. Use the conversation context as the primary dataset, including outputs from Stage 2.5 and earlier stages.

SEARCH POLICY (IMPORTANT)
- Use web search only when you need to fill a missing, load-bearing input that is not available in context.
- Prefer primary sources first (company filings/IR, official exchange data), then reputable aggregators.
- Cite sources used.
- Do not “research everything”; search only to unblock missing essentials or to validate a suspicious/conflicting number.

HARD QC RULES
A) All numerical calculations must be done in Python. Show intermediate numbers and final results.
B) Every assumption must be labeled SOURCE (if backed by a cited source or a quote/excerpt in context) or ASSUMPTION. Add CONFIDENCE (H/M/L).
C) Shares: use “diluted shares outstanding today” (current shares plus in-the-money dilution if available). Do not use EPS weighted-average diluted shares.
D) Do not allocate acquisition-driven amortization/intangibles to thesis cash flows. If you cannot credibly isolate incremental depreciation tied to incremental investment, do not force it; model incremental cash flows directly.
E) Treat wedge NPV as EV-additive. Do not subtract net debt from the wedge. Net debt is handled once at the core/total level.
   Exception: if thesis requires material financing or causes dilution, flag it and reflect it (either adjust shares / net debt or show a clearly labeled variant).
F) Anti-double-count: incremental means “thesis path minus the same baseline path embedded in CORE assumptions.” If baseline differs, reconcile before proceeding.
G) Wedge persistence: do not assume the wedge is perpetual by default. Classify persistence (wave/cycle vs durable steady-state change) and only then decide whether a long-term component exists.
H) Wedge sanity checks: wedge should be monotonic (Bear ≤ Base ≤ Bull). If not, flag and fix scenario logic or explain a real mechanism that causes it.



STEP 1 — EXTRACT THE STAGE 2.5 HANDOFF (FROM CONTEXT)
Create a “Context Pack” table with:
- Company, ticker, reporting currency
- Current price (with date)
- Diluted shares today (and what it includes)
- CORE value per share (V_core_base at minimum; bear/bull if available)
- Monetization Path A/B/C and Dominant Driver (from Stage 2.5)
- One-line thesis stream definition (what is included)
If any of the following are missing from context: price, diluted shares, and a usable baseline definition, run search to obtain them; if still unavailable, list exactly what is missing and STOP.

ANCHOR INHERITANCE: Stage 6 must inherit the Anchor Date/Year 0 baseline from Stage 2.5 (Revenue₀, FCF₀/margin₀, diluted shares, net debt/cash). If Stage 2.5 does not explicitly provide any of these, estimate them by rebuilding the same Anchor Date baseline from the latest available filings and proceed with clearly labeled assumptions.
STEP 2 — DEFINE THE WEDGE OBJECT (PRECISELY)
A) Thesis stream: explicitly list inclusions/exclusions (products, services, segment scope, geography).
B) Baseline: identify what is already in Year 0 financials (thesis already partially present, if applicable).
C) Incremental definition: state clearly that wedge is the difference between “thesis path” and “no-thesis baseline path” that matches the CORE baseline.
D) Horizon: Years 1–3 plus a possible long-term component (only if persistence is durable). Currency: reporting currency.

STEP 3 — BASELINE ALIGNMENT AND RECONCILIATION (ANTI-DOUBLE-COUNT)
Before modeling anything:
- Check whether your baseline scope matches CORE (same segment scope, same currency, same fiscal period conventions).
- If there is a mismatch, fix it by reconciling the scope (FX/segment coverage/calendar/normalization) and record what you changed.
Output a one-line verdict: Baseline alignment = OK / Adjusted (and what was adjusted).

STEP 4 — ROUTING GATE (A/B/C) — USE ONLY THE RELEVANT MODULE
Use the Monetization Path from Stage 2.5:

PATH A — VOLUME-LED (Growth-dominated)
Use pool sizing + capture + capacity constraints, then convert into incremental cash flows.

PATH B — MARGIN-RESET (Margin-dominated)
Do NOT do TAM theater by default. Model wedge primarily as incremental cash flow from margin/efficiency changes on the baseline revenue base plus any implementation reinvestment.

PATH C — MACRO-BETA (WACC-dominated)
Do NOT fabricate a cash-flow wedge if the thesis is primarily rerating/discount-regime. Produce a “Macro Pack” (valuation sensitivity vs discount rate/multiple regime) and set wedge cash-flow NPV to N/A unless the context clearly specifies a real incremental cash-flow mechanism.

STEP 5 — BUILD BEAR/BASE/BULL SCENARIOS (REALISTIC)
Define Bear/Base/Bull for the wedge, consistent with the thesis timing and constraints.
- Base: best defensible case given current evidence.
- Bear: realistic friction (slower adoption, pricing pressure, qualification delays, tighter capacity, higher reinvestment, etc.).
- Bull: realistic acceleration; if it requires capacity expansion not evidenced, explicitly mark “capacity-dependent bull”.
Assign probabilities 25/50/25 unless the context specifies otherwise.

PATH A MODULE — POOL → CAPTURE → CASH
A1) Size the incremental pool using at least 2 independent methods (3 if feasible without hand-waving):
- Served market build (served TAM/SAM) with explicit constraints (supply, regulation, qualification, lead times, budgets).
- Entity-based build (entities × spending uplift × adopti

Wedge persistence classification (mandatory):
- Wave: no terminal value; or terminal with explicit fade schedule to 0 by year 6–8.
- Durable shift: terminal allowed with conservative g.
- Step-change with reinvestment: terminal allowed only if incremental maintenance reinvestment is modeled.
If persistence is not classified, STOP.
Anti-double-count numeric test:
Compute baseline_FCF_core_year0 and baseline_FCF_wedge_year0 on same scope.
If |baseline_FCF_core - baseline_FCF_wedge| > 5% of baseline_FCF_core, flag DOUBLE COUNT RISK and reconcile before proceeding.

This will help for the next stage: Stage 7 - Reverse DCF (whole company / TOTAL).
◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
# STAGE 7 — REVERSE DCF (TOTAL / WHOLE COMPANY)

You are conducting a Reverse DCF analysis to extract what expectations are already priced into a stock and determine whether there is actionable mispricing versus a thesis. This is NOT a fair-value exercise. Your output must be decision-grade, auditable, and internally consistent.

CORE PRINCIPLE — CONSISTENCY OF THE VALUATION OBJECT
You must never compare a thesis-only incremental valuation to the full stock price. All “priced-in”, “market-implied”, asymmetry, and tier classification metrics must be computed on the SAME valuation object as the market price: whole-company Equity Value (or whole-company Enterprise Value translated to Equity Value).

COMPUTATION + DATA REQUIREMENTS

* Use Python for ALL numerical calculations: discounting, DCF, NPV, CAGR, root-finding, sensitivity, return profiles.
* Explicitly state which results were computed in Python.
* Verify current market data via internet search when needed: stock price, market cap, enterprise value, net debt, diluted shares outstanding.
* Use Enterprise Value (EV) as the primary reverse-DCF anchor, then convert to Equity Value per share using net debt and current diluted shares outstanding.
* IMPORTANT: “Diluted shares outstanding” means current shares outstanding plus in-the-money dilution (RSUs, options, convertibles). Do NOT use diluted weighted-average shares from the income statement.

PREREQUISITES CHECK — STOP IF ANY ARE MISSING
Step 0.1 Identify which inputs you have:

TIME CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENT: Use the same workflow Anchor Date/Year 0 baseline as Stage 2.5/Stage 6 for Revenue₀ and FCF₀/margin₀. If any inputs (price date, shares date, net debt date, financial baseline) are on different cutoffs or FY vs TTM, automatically rebase/align them to the Anchor Date and then run the root-finding for market-implied growth and margin.

A) WHOLE-COMPANY SCENARIOS (preferred)
You have Bear/Base/Bull scenarios for the entire company, each containing:

* Whole-company starting revenue (base fiscal year)
* Revenue growth (Years 1–3) as CAGR or explicit path
* FCF margin in Year 3 (and a defined margin path from today to Y3)
* WACC and terminal growth (g)
* Scenario probabilities

B) THESIS-INCREMENTAL SCENARIOS ONLY (common)
You have Bear/Base/Bull NPVs that represent ONLY incremental thesis value (not the whole company). If so, you must also have:

* A Base Business valuation (whole-company excluding incremental thesis) using either:

  1. Base-business DCF, or
  2. Base-business multiple on normalized FCF/EBIT
* A clear definition of what is “incremental” so you do NOT double-count cash flows already included in the base business.

If you cannot construct whole-company Bear/Base/Bull equity values per share with the inputs available, STOP and list exactly what is missing.

NEW — Step 0.2 HORIZON CALIBRATION (MANDATORY, PRE-PRICE)
Purpose: avoid compressing long-cycle theses into a 3-year model which can distort market-implied assumptions.
Rules:
* Choose an explicit horizon N for the DCF cash-flow projection from this set: N ∈ {3, 5, 7, 10}.
* Select N BEFORE solving any market-implied parameter and BEFORE comparing to current price diagnostics.
* N must be justified using Stage 0/1/6 (thesis structure, procurement cycle, persistence), not market price.

Horizon selection rubric (use the best-fitting archetype):
* N = 3: fast-cycle software/short-contract businesses where thesis impact mostly lands within 0–24 months.
* N = 5: mixed-cycle businesses where adoption and margins settle within 2–4 years.
* N = 7: infrastructure/industrial buildouts where procurement, qualification, construction and capacity expansion create 3–6 year runways.
* N = 10: regulated or multi-cycle infrastructure where capex programs and backlog conversion extend beyond 7 years.

Mandatory stability check:
* Compute an N-sensitivity diagnostic at N_minus = max(3, N-2) and N_plus = min(10, N+2).
* If market-implied results materially change across N_minus, N, N_plus, flag MODEL-RISK and downgrade confidence.

NON-NEGOTIABLE MODELING RULES

1. No linear interpolation of CAGR between scenario NPVs. DCF is non-linear.
2. If the current price lies outside your Bear–Bull scenario value range, do NOT extrapolate linearly. Solve directly with a root-finding method.
3. Market-implied assumptions must be solved by making PV(FCF) equal to current EV (or equity value per share) via root finding.
4. If the company is a bank/insurer/commodity producer, a standard FCF DCF may be inappropriate. In that case, stop and recommend the correct model class (excess returns/cycle-normalized), unless the user explicitly insists on FCF DCF.

NEW — Rule 5 (DCF object consistency):
If you discount to EV using WACC, the cash flow must be FCFF-consistent. If only levered FCF is available, convert to an FCFF proxy (e.g., add after-tax cash interest) or clearly state limitations.

OBJECTIVE OF THIS REVERSE DCF
Compute the market-implied assumptions (growth and/or margin and/or reinvestment intensity) that justify today’s price, then compare those assumptions to your Base case thesis assumptions to quantify mispricing.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

STEP 1 — BUILD A CONSISTENT WHOLE-COMPANY SCENARIO SET (MANDATORY)
1.1 If you already have whole-company Bear/Base/Bull equity value per share scenarios, use them.
1.2 If you only have thesis-incremental scenarios, build Sum-of-Parts (SoP) scenarios.
Preconditions (must hold):
• EV_core_s and EV_wedge_s are in the same currency, same valuation date, and same Year 0 fiscal baseline.
• Wedge cash flows are strictly incremental vs the CORE baseline (no double-count).
Build SoP at the EV level:
• EV_total_s = EV_core_s + EV_wedge_s
• NetDebt_total_s = NetDebt_core_s + ΔNetDebt_s (only if wedge requires financing; else 0)
• DilutedShares_total_s = DilutedShares_core + ΔShares_s (only if wedge causes dilution; else 0)
• EquityValuePerShare_total_s = (EV_total_s − NetDebt_total_s) / DilutedShares_total_s
Only if ΔNetDebt_s = 0 and ΔShares_s = 0 may you safely add per-share values (EV-level is still preferred).
Persistence (inherit from Stage 6):
• Wave wedge: model explicit ΔFCF through a fade schedule (e.g., out to year 6–8) and set wedge terminal contribution = 0.
• Durable wedge: terminal allowed only with explicit maintenance reinvestment logic.
Discounting:
• Use consistent WACC/g across parts unless you explicitly justify different risk rates.
• Avoid double-discounting (do not combine extreme probabilities with extreme wedge discount premium without justification).

STEP 2 — DEFINE THE WHOLE-COMPANY DCF FUNCTION (PYTHON)
In Python, implement a whole-company DCF function returning Equity Value per share given assumptions:
Inputs:
* Revenue_0 (base fiscal year revenue)
* Growth parameterization for Years 1–3 (either a single CAGR or a simple curve)
* FCF margin path for Years 1–3 (at minimum: linear interpolation from current FCF margin to Year 3 FCF margin)
* WACC
* Terminal growth g (must be < WACC; typically 2–3%)
* Net debt
* Diluted shares outstanding
Mechanics:
* Revenue_t = Revenue_0 × (1 + growth) ^ t  (or your explicit path)
* FCF_t = Revenue_t × FCFMargin_t
* PV_FCF = Σ_{t=1..3} FCF_t / (1+WACC)^t
* TV = FCF_3 × (1+g) / (WACC − g)
* PV_TV = TV / (1+WACC)^3
* EV = PV_FCF + PV_TV
* EquityValue = EV − NetDebt
* EquityValuePerShare = EquityValue / DilutedShares

NEW — Step 2.1 CASH FLOW CONSISTENCY CHECK (MANDATORY)
Before running the EV-anchored DCF:
* Confirm whether your “FCF” is FCFF (unlevered) or levered (after interest).
* If levered, convert to an FCFF proxy (e.g., add after-tax cash interest) OR explicitly state you are using an equity-DCF instead (but then you must NOT use WACC for EV).
* State clearly what you did. If you cannot make the object consistent, STOP and recommend the correct approach.

NEW — Step 2.2 HORIZON-AWARE EXTENSION (PRIMARY WHEN N > 3)
If Horizon N (from Step 0.2) is > 3, extend the DCF mechanics WITHOUT changing the valuation object:
* Keep “market-implied” parameter as g_1_3 (growth for years 1–3) and margin_3 (FCF margin in year 3) to remain compatible with the rest of the pipeline.
* For years 4..N, apply a fade of growth from g_1_3 toward g_terminal by year N (linear fade is acceptable).
* For margin, default to holding margin_3 constant for years 4..N unless the thesis persistence in Stage 6 requires a fade (Wave case) or explicit reinvestment logic (Durable case).
* Compute PV_FCF for t=1..N and terminal value at year N:
  - PV_FCF = Σ_{t=1..N} FCF_t / (1+WACC)^t
  - TV = FCF_N × (1+g_terminal) / (WACC − g_terminal)
  - PV_TV = TV / (1+WACC)^N
* Mandatory diagnostic: report terminal share = PV_TV / (PV_FCF + PV_TV). High terminal share implies WACC sensitivity.

STEP 3 — MARKET POSITION VS YOUR SCENARIOS (WHOLE-COMPANY)
Compute using whole-company Bear/Base/Bull Equity Value per share:
* %PricedIn = (Price − Bear) / (Bull − Bear) × 100
* Gap_to_Base = (Base − Price) / Price
* Gap_to_Bull = (Bull − Price) / Price
If %PricedIn < 0 or > 100, treat it as “outside range” diagnostic, not a basis for interpolation.

STEP 4 — SOLVE MARKET-IMPLIED ASSUMPTIONS (ROOT-FINDING, PYTHON)
You must solve directly, not interpolate.

4.1 Market-implied growth (primary)
* Hold the FCF margin path fixed to your Base case margin path (or a clearly stated neutral path).
* Solve for the 3-year revenue CAGR that makes EquityValuePerShare == CurrentPrice.
* Use bisection (or another robust root finder).
* Report the market-implied CAGR.

4.2 Market-implied Year-3 FCF margin (secondary, preferred)
* Hold growth fixed to your Base case growth.
* Solve for Year-3 FCF margin that makes EquityValuePerShare == CurrentPrice.
* Report the market-implied Year-3 FCF margin.

4.3 Optional but strongly recommended: 2D equivalence map
* Compute a small grid of (CAGR, FCF margin Y3) combinations that fit the current price.
* Report 3–5 representative points to show trade-offs (e.g., high growth/low margin vs lower growth/higher margin).

4.4 If SoP is used (thesis-incremental inputs)
* Compute implied thesis value per share = CurrentPrice − BaseBusinessValuePerShare_current.
* Within the thesis incremental DCF, solve for one implied thesis driver (preferably capture rate or thesis CAGR) such that ThesisNPVPerShare == implied thesis value per share.
* Do not compare thesis-only NPV to full price.

NEW — Step 4.5 HORIZON STABILITY DIAGNOSTIC (MANDATORY)
Using N_minus, N, N_plus from Step 0.2:
* Repeat Step 4.1 and Step 4.2 at N_minus and N_plus.
* If implied CAGR or implied margin materially changes across horizons, flag MODEL-RISK and explicitly downgrade confidence and tier strength.

STEP 5 — RISK-REWARD METRICS (TOTAL EQUITY VALUE PER SHARE, PYTHON)
Precondition: Price, Bear, Base, Bull are all TOTAL Equity Value per share (EV→Equity bridge already applied).
If Price ≤ Bear or Bull ≤ Price, treat as “outside range” and do not compute AsymmetryRatio; proceed to root-finding diagnostics.

Compute (Python):
• ExpectedValue = pBearBear + pBaseBase + pBull*Bull
• ExpectedValueUpside% = ExpectedValue / Price − 1

CORRECTION (do not remove the original line, but use this for calculations):
• ExpectedValue = pBear*Bear + pBase*Base + pBull*Bull

Risk/Reward (percent-based):
• Upside% = Bull / Price − 1
• Downside% = 1 − Bear / Price
• AsymmetryRatio = Upside% / Downside%

Cross-check (must match numerically):
• AsymmetryRatio_check = (Bull − Price) / (Price − Bear)

Optional reporting (do NOT use to compute asymmetry):
• BullMultiple = Bull / Price
• BearMultiple = Bear / Price

NEW — Terminal share diagnostic (mandatory reporting):
• TerminalShare = PV_TV / (PV_FCF + PV_TV)
If TerminalShare is very high, state explicitly that the result is WACC-sensitive and resembles a duration/regime bet.

STEP 6 — DIVERGENCE DIAGNOSIS (EXPLAIN THE GAP)
Explain precisely why your Base case differs from market-implied assumptions. Anchor to mechanisms, not vibes:
* TAM/pool size
* capture/share durability
* monetization speed
* margin durability vs mix shift
* reinvestment intensity and working-capital drag
* competitive response and customer concentration
Provide a clear catalyst timeline (6–12 months) and what specific data would confirm/refute your view (VOI).

TIER CLASSIFICATION (WHOLE-COMPANY ONLY)
Tier 1 — Strong Buy: Market-implied CAGR > 500 bps below Base, Expected value > 50% above current, Asymmetry > 4:1, Bull > 5×, Base > 2.5×, Bear downside < 40%
Tier 2 — Attractive: Market-implied CAGR > 300 bps below Base, Expected value > 30% above current, Asymmetry > 3:1, Bull > 3×, Base > 1.8×, Bear downside < 50%
Tier 3 — Fair Value: Market within ±200 bps of Base, Expected value 10–30% above current, Asymmetry 2–3:1
Tier 4 — Avoid: Market at/above Base, Expected value < 10% above current, Asymmetry < 2:1, Bear downside > 50%

NEW — Tier integrity guard:
If MODEL-RISK is flagged from Step 4.5 (horizon instability), cap the output signal at Tier 3 pending additional VOI confirmation.

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT
Your final response must include:

1. Market Expectations
* Market-implied revenue CAGR (Python)
* Market-implied Year-3 FCF margin (Python)
* Brief assessment vs historical growth/margins
* %PricedIn using whole-company scenarios (or SoP with implied thesis value separated)

NEW (additional required reporting):
* Horizon N selection (from Step 0.2) and N_minus/N_plus sensitivity summary
* TerminalShare diagnostic

2. Scenario Comparison Table (4 rows)
Bear / Market / Base / Bull with: revenue CAGR, FCF margin Y3, equity value per share, % vs current price

3. Risk-Reward Analysis
* Expected value and % vs current price
* Asymmetry ratio (and check via multiples)
* 5-year returns (multiples and CAGRs, Python)
* Threshold checks: Bull > 5×, Base > 2×, Bear survivable

4. The Divergence
* What the market is assuming that you disagree with
* Your different expectation with evidence
* Catalyst timeline and VOI metrics
* If relevant, show how pool/capture/margin assumptions drive the gap

5. Decision Signal
* Tier classification
* One-sentence rationale linking mispricing to structural advantage and catalyst timing

Style: concise, decision-oriented, auditable. No generic filler. No linear interpolation. No object mismatch.
Focus on actionable conclusions. Show all key calculations and assumptions explicitly, and ensure the object of valuation is consistent throughout.

This will help for the next stage: Stage 8 - Four-Gate Decision (BUY/WATCH/AVOID).
◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
ROLE
You are the Stage 8 decision engine in our thesis-driven investment pipeline. For ONE company, you must produce a single actionable decision: BUY / WATCH / AVOID.

You do not invent a new thesis.
You do not “research for fun.”
You do not create new numbers.
You only synthesize and decide using outputs that already exist from earlier stages.

Your job is to:
1) verify the analysis is internally consistent,
2) run a disciplined Four-Gate decision (Integrity, Quality, Value, Proof, Execution),
3) translate the result into a practical position plan (enter, add, reduce, exit),
4) refuse false certainty when key stages are missing.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CORE CONCEPT — LOCK THE VALUATION OBJECT (this fixes “Berlin-style” errors)
We have three different valuation objects. Mixing them produces wrong decisions.

- CORE: the base business value without the thesis effect
- WEDGE: the incremental value created by the thesis (only the difference vs CORE)
- TOTAL: CORE + WEDGE (the only object that can be compared to the stock price)

Hard rules:
1) Asymmetry, priced-in, reverse DCF, divergence, tier signals, and the final BUY/WATCH/AVOID decision must be computed ONLY on TOTAL.
2) WEDGE may be compared to price ONLY as a “thesis contribution ratio”:
   Wedge_to_Price = Expected_WEDGE / Price
   WEDGE is never a price target and never the intrinsic value of the stock.
3) If you cannot construct consistent TOTAL Bear/Base/Bull scenarios, you MUST output:
   DECISION: WATCH
   CATEGORY: DATA_GAPS
   and STOP.

AVOID rule:
- AVOID is reserved for structural/quality failure (Gate 1 FAIL: permanent impairment risk).
- “Too expensive” or “not enough proof yet” is WATCH, not AVOID.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHERE EACH INPUT COMES FROM (stage-to-stage map)
You must explicitly reference the stage that supplies each component. Do not guess.
If a stage does not provide the required object, you must treat it as a gap.

Stage 0 — Thesis Object
- Premise (“If X then Y because Z”)
- 2–3 gating constraints
- Weakest link in value capture
- Disconfirmers (what would break the thesis)

Stage 1 — Sub-segment Validation
- The 2–3 precise sub-segments (defined by “what buyers purchase”)
- Timing logic and why the profit pool concentrates there

Stage 2 — Stock Universe
- Company’s value-chain role
- Thesis exposure mechanism
- Single biggest company-specific risk

Stage 2.5 — Reverse DCF Lite + Driver-of-Value Screen
- Valuation object declaration (FULL / SoP)
- CORE values (Bear/Base/Bull if available)
- TOTAL values (Bear/Base/Bull if available)
- Dominant driver (growth vs margin vs WACC)
- Monetization path A/B/C

Stage 3 — Competitive Position
- Replaceability test results
- Moat type and durability
- Market structure and adoption dynamics (“pilot → production → scale”)
- Operational KPIs that track real-world progress

Stage 4 — DuPont / Returns Quality
- ROE decomposition (margin × turnover × leverage)
- Whether returns are operational vs leverage-driven
- 3-year directional impact of the thesis on ROE drivers

Stage 5 — Revaluation Parameter Selection
- The ONE chosen Revaluation Parameter
- Upside surprise threshold
- VOI event and timing
- Deliverability assessment

Stage 6 — Thesis Monetization (WEDGE ONLY)
- Incremental WEDGE NPV/share Bear/Base/Bull
- Persistence class: Wave vs Durable vs Step-change
- Top 3 value drivers
- Falsifiers with thresholds and time windows

Stage 7 — Reverse DCF (WHOLE COMPANY / TOTAL)
- Market-implied growth and/or market-implied margin (root-finding)
- Consistent TOTAL Bear/Base/Bull values
- “Priced-in” diagnostics
- Sensitivities: ±growth, ±margin, ±WACC

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE DECISION PROCESS (follow strictly)

GATE 0 — INTEGRITY (mandatory STOP gate)
Purpose: prevent methodological failure before debating the stock.

You must confirm:
A) You have consistent TOTAL Bear/Base/Bull scenarios (prefer Stage 7; fallback Stage 2.5).
B) Stage 6 WEDGE is truly incremental vs the CORE used to build TOTAL (no double counting).
C) Stage 2.5 dominant driver and path (A/B/C) are known and will be respected in interpretation:
   - Path A (volume-led): pool/capture drives value.
   - Path B (margin-reset): mix/pricing/utilization drives value.
   - Path C (WACC-dominated): this is a regime bet unless there is a real incremental cash-flow mechanism.

If any of A/B/C is not satisfied:
- DECISION: WATCH
- CATEGORY: DATA_GAPS
- List exactly what is missing and which stage must provide it
Then STOP.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GATE 1 — QUALITY (permanent impairment risk)
Purpose: eliminate situations where you can lose capital permanently.

Use Stage 3 + Stage 4 + the CORE “floor” from Stage 2.5.

Rate each as PASS / RISK / FAIL:
1) Moat and replaceability
2) Financial durability (leverage, refinancing, cost of capital resilience)
3) Cash quality (earnings-to-cash conversion, repeatable FCF)
4) Resilience if the thesis slows (CORE can stand on its own)
5) External/binary risks and whether they have measurable leading indicators

If any item is FAIL:
- DECISION: AVOID
- CATEGORY: STRUCTURAL
- State the main reason in 1–2 sentences
Then STOP.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GATE 2 — VALUE (is the price favorable?)
Purpose: separate “great company” from “good price.”
This gate is computed ONLY on TOTAL.

Required formulas (TOTAL):
1) Total asymmetry:
   Asymmetry_TOTAL = (Bull_TOTAL − Price) / (Price − Bear_TOTAL)

2) Expected value (TOTAL):
   EV_TOTAL = 0.25*Bear_TOTAL + 0.50*Base_TOTAL + 0.25*Bull_TOTAL
   EV_Upside = (EV_TOTAL / Price) − 1

3) Priced-in diagnostic (not a valuation, just a check):
   PricedIn% = (Price − Bear_TOTAL) / (Bull_TOTAL − Bear_TOTAL)

4) Divergence vs market (from Stage 7 reverse DCF):
   Divergence_growth = Base_CAGR − MarketImplied_CAGR
   Divergence_margin = Base_FCFmY3 − MarketImplied_FCFmY3
Report both if available. If only one exists, report it and state the limitation.

WEDGE diagnostic (allowed, but not a target):
- Wedge_to_Price = Expected_WEDGE / Price (from Stage 6)

Interpretation must respect Stage 2.5 dominant driver:
- Growth-dominated: divergence and asymmetry should be explained via adoption/capture.
- Margin-dominated: divergence must be explained via pricing power, mix, utilization, and cost structure.
- WACC-dominated (Path C): you must require regime-related VOI or a clearly evidenced cash-flow mechanism; otherwise default to WATCH.

Thresholds:
- PASS: Asymmetry_TOTAL ≥ 3.0 and divergence is meaningful
- RISK: Asymmetry_TOTAL 2.0–3.0 or divergence is small/uncertain
- FAIL: Asymmetry_TOTAL < 2.0 or market is already pricing Base or better
Important: Gate 2 FAIL means “too expensive / insufficient asymmetry,” not “bad company.”

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GATE 3 — PROOF & VOI (is the thesis showing up in reality?)
Purpose: anchor conviction to measurable signals that update probability soon.

Score 0–5 and classify LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH:
- Proof (0–2): KPI trends align with the money-mechanism and persist over time (Stage 3 + Stage 6)
- Edge (0–2): you have a non-obvious, testable mechanism (Layer 3+ or gating constraint) (Stage 0/3)
- VOI (0–1): at least one concrete event within 6 months that materially updates probability (Stage 5)

You must list:
- KPI confirm: metric + threshold + time window
- KPI warn: metric + threshold + time window
- KPI falsify: metric + threshold + time window
- VOI event: what and when

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GATE 4 — EXECUTION (turn the decision into actions)
Purpose: produce an implementable plan, not an essay.

Use Stage 4 (position rules), Stage 6 (drivers + falsifiers), and Stage 7 (valuation triggers).

Provide:
1) Position approach: STARTER / STANDARD / AGGRESSIVE
2) Entry in 2–3 tranches:
   - Tranche 1: when to start (price trigger and/or initial VOI trigger)
   - Tranche 2: what VOI confirmation triggers adding
   - Tranche 3: what “economics confirmation” triggers adding (margin/backlog/pricing/utilization)
3) Monitoring plan:
   - what to track, how often, and which stage defines the KPI
4) Reduce/exit triggers:
   - one thesis falsifier (Stage 6)
   - one company-specific exit (Stage 3/5)
   - one valuation-too-expensive trigger (Stage 7)
5) If current decision is WATCH, you must state an explicit upgrade-to-BUY rule:
   - a price trigger and/or
   - a VOI/KPI trigger that would justify today’s price

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FINAL DECISION LOGIC
1) If Gate 0 fails: WATCH / DATA_GAPS
2) If Gate 1 has any FAIL: AVOID / STRUCTURAL
3) If Gate 1 PASS and Gate 2 FAIL: WATCH / TOO_EXPENSIVE
4) If Gate 1 PASS, Gate 2 PASS, and Gate 3 is not LOW: BUY / OK
5) Otherwise: WATCH / INSUFFICIENT_PROOF or TIMING (choose the real blocker)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
OUTPUT FORMAT (English, plain and readable, no new claims)
[Company] (Ticker:Exchange)
DECISION: BUY / WATCH / AVOID
CATEGORY: OK / TOO_EXPENSIVE / STRUCTURAL / DATA_GAPS / INSUFFICIENT_PROOF / TIMING

Gate 0 — Integrity: PASS/FAIL
- If FAIL: list missing stage outputs and STOP.

Gate 1 — Quality: PASS/RISK/FAIL
- Moat/replaceability (Stage 3)
- Returns quality and leverage cleanliness (Stage 4)
- CORE floor resilience (Stage 2.5)
- External/binary risks + leading indicators (Stage 0/3/6)

Gate 2 — Value: PASS/RISK/FAIL
- Bear_TOTAL, Base_TOTAL, Bull_TOTAL, Price
- Asymmetry_TOTAL (show arithmetic)
- Divergence vs market (Stage 7 implied vs Base)
- Wedge_to_Price (Stage 6) as a diagnostic only

Gate 3 — Proof & VOI: X/5 → LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH
- KPI confirm / warn / falsify (Stage 3/6)
- VOI event (Stage 5)

Gate 4 — Execution plan
- Position approach
- Tranches and conditions
- Monitoring cadence
- Reduce/exit triggers
- Upgrade-to-BUY rule (if WATCH)

Main risk (one sentence, cause → effect)
VOI trigger (one line)
Falsifier (one line)

## 📊 Szczegółowy opis pól

### 1. Data decyzji

Format: `RRRR-MM-DD`

---

### 2. Status decyzji

Wybierz dokładnie jedno:

- **BUY** — kupuj
- **AVOID** — unikaj
- **WATCH** — obserwuj

---

### 3. Spółka

Format: `Nazwa Spółki (TICKER:GIEŁDA)`

Przykłady:

- Richemont (CFR:SW)
- Tradeweb Markets Inc. (TW:NASDAQ)
- Lockheed Martin (LMT:NYSE)

Zasady:

- Bez cudzysłowów i przecinków
- Jeśli ticker nieznany → tylko nazwa, np. Palantir Technologies
- Używaj standardowych kodów giełd: NASDAQ, NYSE, SW, LSE, GPW itd.
- Format kompatybilny z Google Sheets i funkcją `=GOOGLEFINANCE()`

---

### 4. Krótkie streszczenie tezy

1-2 zdania — esencja mechanizmu wartości.

Przykład:
> Bifurkacja rynku diamentów i migracja marż do marek natural-only

---

### 5. Materiał źródłowy / podcast

Źródło, z którego pochodzi teza lub inspiracja.

Przykłady:

- Podcast: The Economist Money Talks — De Beers a diamenty laboratoryjne
- Raport: Morgan Stanley Semiconductors Q4 2024
- Artykuł: WSJ — The End of Cloud CAPEX

---

### 6. Teza inwestycyjna (dlaczego ta firma)

3-5 zdań, pisane językiem strategicznym.

**Struktura:**

- **Kontekst** — co się zmienia w branży (trend, katalizator, regulacja)
- **Pozycja** — jak firma jest ustawiona wobec tej zmiany (technologia, zasób, sieć, dostęp)
- **Logika inwestycyjna** — dlaczego rynek tego nie wycenia (mispricing, timing, błędna percepcja)

**Przykład:**

> Globalny rynek diamentów ulega bifurkacji – tańsze kamienie laboratoryjne poszerzają rynek, podczas gdy wartość i marże koncentrują się w segmencie natural high jewelry. Richemont, poprzez marki Cartier i Van Cleef & Arpels, kontroluje narrację rzadkości oraz kanały DTC, co umożliwia utrzymanie premium pricing i stabilnych przepływów w segmencie VIC. Rynek nadal wycenia spółkę jak tradycyjnego jubilera, pomijając trwały efekt miksu produktowego i przeniesienia popytu do kategorii kolekcjonerskiej.

**Nie używaj:**

- Żargonu finansowego
- Surowych wskaźników (P/E, EV/EBITDA)
- Fraz typu "atrakcyjna wycena" bez kontekstu

---

### 7. Wątpliwości / ryzyka

Przedstaw jasno co może pójść nie tak i dlaczego.
Nie opisuj wskaźników — tylko zależności przyczynowo-skutkowe.

Przykłady:

- Tempo adopcji może być niższe, jeśli integracja systemów partnerów się opóźni
- Rosnące koszty finansowania mogą zredukować atrakcyjność CAPEX-u elektryfikacyjnego
- Brak wspólnego standardu może zatrzymać efekt sieciowy

---

### 8. Gate rating (G1–G4)

Dla każdej z czterech bram podaj: status oraz krótkie uzasadnienie (dlaczego przeszło/nie przeszło i co się dowiedzieliśmy).

**Format:**

```
G1:[STATUS] - [uzasadnienie]; G2:[STATUS] - [uzasadnienie]; G3:[LEVEL] - [uzasadnienie]; G4:[STATUS] - [uzasadnienie]
```

**Statusy:**

- G1, G2, G4: `PASS` / `FAIL` / `RISK`
- G3: `LOW` / `MEDIUM` / `HIGH`

⚠️ **UWAGA:** Używaj przecinków i myślników w uzasadnieniach, **NIE** średników.

**Przykład:**

> G1:PASS - bifurkacja rynku potwierdzona danymi De Beers, trend nieodwracalny; G2:PASS - marki Cartier i Van Cleef mają ugruntowaną pozycję w segmencie natural-only; G3:HIGH - kontrola narracji i kanałów DTC daje trwałą przewagę cenową; G4:ACTIVE - wzrost udziału high jewelry w miksie widoczny w raportach kwartalnych

---

### 9. Asymetria / Divergence

Krótka ocena relacji ryzyko/nagroda i percepcji rynku.

**Format:**

```
Asymetria: X:1, Divergence: Y× — krótki komentarz
```

**Przykład:**

> Asymetria: 3.5:1, Divergence: 1.4× — rynek nie doszacowuje trwałej przewagi marek natural-only

---

### 10. VOI / Falsifiers / Primary risk

Zawiera trzy elementy oddzielone przecinkami lub średnikami wewnętrznymi:

- **VOI** (Value of Information) — co musi się wydarzyć, żeby zwiększyć pozycję
- **Falsifiers** — co unieważni tezę
- **Primary risk** — główny czynnik destrukcji wartości

**Przykład:**

> VOI: potwierdzenie wzrostu udziału high jewelry powyżej 10%, Fals: brak ożywienia popytu w Chinach do 2Q, Primary risk: trwałe przesunięcie popytu w stronę laboratoryjnych diamentów

---

### 11. Sektor

Wybierz **TYLKO** jedną nazwę z poniższej listy (bez opisów, nawiasów, myślników):

| Sektor                                   | Teza sektorowa (kontekst)                                                                        |

## ✅ Przykład kompletnego outputu

### Bez numeracji (finalna forma):

```
2025-10-14; BUY; Richemont (CFR:SW); Bifurkacja rynku diamentów i migracja marż do marek natural-only; Podcast: The Economist Money Talks — De Beers a diamenty laboratoryjne; Globalny rynek diamentów ulega bifurkacji – tańsze kamienie laboratoryjne poszerzają rynek, podczas gdy wartość i marże koncentrują się w segmencie natural high jewelry. Richemont, poprzez marki Cartier i Van Cleef & Arpels, kontroluje narrację rzadkości oraz kanały DTC, co umożliwia utrzymanie premium pricing i stabilnych przepływów w segmencie VIC. Rynek nadal wycenia spółkę jak tradycyjnego jubilera, pomijając trwały efekt miksu produktowego i przeniesienia popytu do kategorii kolekcjonerskiej; Spowolnienie popytu w Azji i USA oraz umocnienie CHF mogą ograniczyć rotację w segmencie high jewelry, a regulacje dotyczące pochodzenia kamieni mogą wprowadzić dodatkowe tarcia operacyjne; G1:PASS - bifurkacja rynku potwierdzona danymi De Beers, trend nieodwracalny; G2:PASS - marki Cartier i Van Cleef mają ugruntowaną pozycję w segmencie natural-only; G3:HIGH - kontrola narracji i kanałów DTC daje trwałą przewagę cenową; G4:ACTIVE - wzrost udziału high jewelry w miksie widoczny w raportach kwartalnych; Asymetria: 3.5:1, Divergence: 1.4× — rynek nie doszacowuje trwałej przewagi marek natural-only; VOI: potwierdzenie wzrostu udziału high jewelry powyżej 10%, Fals: brak ożywienia popytu w Chinach do 2Q, Primary risk: trwałe przesunięcie popytu w stronę laboratoryjnych diamentów; Handel & zachowania konsumenta; Szwajcaria; CHF; #rosnacy_moat #zdrowy_bilans #katalizatory_w_horyzoncie #przyspieszajaca_adopcja; #slaba_trakcja_klientow #ryzyko_regulacyjne #ryzyko_podazowe
