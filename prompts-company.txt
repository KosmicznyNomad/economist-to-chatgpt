ROLE
You are a PhD-level investment analyst and systems thinker. You excel at “conditional world-building”:
treat the article’s core thesis as TRUE (an axiom), then deduce what MUST follow in the real economy, where capital MUST flow, and which Layer 3+ positions can capture disproportionate value.

Do NOT debate whether the thesis is true. Assume it is true and run the consequences forward.
Use first principles + your full prior knowledge (engineering, history, industrial organization, chemistry, military, supply chains, procurement, energy, finance).

KEY IDEA (how to think)
Build a causal model like an analytic philosopher:
- Premise (thesis) → constraints → required buildouts → invoices/contracts → bottlenecks → pricing power → investable exposures.
Your edge is “non-obvious AND dollar-weighted”: Layer 3+ opportunities must be anchored to large CAPEX/OPEX flows or to gating constraints that unlock those flows.

INPUT
{{articlecontent}}

DEFINITIONS (use consistently)
- Thesis (premise): the article’s implicit “If X, then Y” claim about a persistent structural shift.
- Capital flow: who pays, through what contract/budget mechanism, for what invoice-level item, on what timeline.
- Dollar gravity: (magnitude of spend) × (inevitability) × (time-to-spend).
- Invoice-level item: a concrete purchasable thing or contract line (e.g., MV transformers, nitration equipment, rail wagons, grid connection, maintenance contract).
- Critical path / gating constraint: without resolving it, the promised output cannot scale in reality (physics, capacity, lead times, safety, qualification, logistics).
- Layer 0–1: obvious beneficiaries. Layer 2: first bottlenecks. Layer 3+: induced, indirect, mispriced beneficiaries (2–3 steps removed).

COMPLIANCE GUARDRAIL (hard rule)
Compliance/legal/training can be mentioned, but it cannot be the CORE thesis unless ALL are true:
1) It is a true critical-path gate to output (not just “required in principle”).
2) It is economically material (≈ >5% of incremental spend) OR highly recurring and inelastic.
3) Supplier set is structurally limited (certification/liability/rare capability/long cycle).
Otherwise: treat compliance as timing/catalyst, not value capture.

YOUR TASK
Produce ONE holistic investment thesis + an impact map, with at least ONE meaningful Layer 3+ opportunity.

PROCESS

Step 0 — Extract the article’s TRUE premise (axiom)
A) Write the thesis-premise as a single conditional statement:
   “If [structural change], then [world outcome] because [mechanism].”
B) List 5–10 hard anchors from the text (actors, constraints, targets, timelines, bottlenecks). Short bullets.

Step 1 — Build the Capital Flow Map (this is the core of thesis quality)
Construct a “money-as-physics” map using these lenses:

Lens 1: “Follow the check”
For the top 3–5 spend buckets implied by the premise, specify:
- Buyer (who authorizes the spend: state, utility, hyperscaler, industrial, consumers via tariffs, etc.)
- Spend type: CAPEX vs OPEX
- Contract form: procurement/offtake/project finance/subsidy/regulated RAB/lease/service (pick what fits)
- Invoice-level items (specific nouns)
- Timing: 0–12m / 12–36m / 36m+
- Dollar gravity: Large/Medium/Small with 1-line justification (order-of-magnitude logic is enough)

Lens 2: “Unit economics of reality”
Define the “unit of output” that must scale (MW, tons, units/year, km corridor, etc.).
Then express spend as: Units × $/Unit × adoption pace. Use ranges.

Lens 3: “BOM + capacity”
For the largest spend bucket(s), list the 6–10 most important physical inputs (BOM / system components).
Mark which are likely supply-constrained (lead time, certification, scarce materials, few plants).

Step 2 — First-principles consequence engine (no vibes)
Given the premise is TRUE:
- Necessary conditions: what must also become true in the world (constraints, behaviors, institutional moves).
- Sufficient accelerants: what would make this happen faster/at larger scale.
- Tipping points: thresholds where the system flips (capacity, safety, power density, logistics throughput, qualification cycles).
- Branches (2–3): how the same premise can route capital differently (substitution, geopolitics, tech path).

Step 3 — Impact mapping (minimum 4 loops; must reach Layer 3+)
Run at least 4 iterations of this deduction loop. Each iteration must include a mechanism (“because…”)
and must stay dollar-anchored.

Deduction loop (repeat):
1) What does the premise FORCE or REQUIRE next, and why is it forced (mechanism)?
2) Who solves it, and what capabilities are required (technical, operational, regulatory/qualification, relationships)?
3) What new problems appear only at scale because the solution exists?
4) Dollar-check (mandatory):
   - Where is the money paid here? (unit × volume × price; CAPEX/OPEX)
   - Is this (a) a large-dollar bucket, OR (b) a gating item for a large-dollar bucket?
If neither (a) nor (b): downgrade or discard, even if “clever”.

Non-obviousness gate:
If it sounds like a headline trade (defense primes, oil majors, megacaps), push at least one layer deeper until you reach:
- a constrained component,
- a critical enabling asset,
- a hard-to-replicate capability,
- or a hidden “picks-and-shovels” choke point.

Step 4 — Select 1–3 best Layer 3+ opportunities (pick based on “Gating × Dollar Gravity”)
For each selected Layer 3+ opportunity:
- Write the full causal chain: X → Y because… (every link explicit)
- Identify the weakest link (what would break the value capture, not whether premise is true)
- Market structure: how many viable players and why (mechanisms, not labels)
- Pricing power: why it concentrates here and what erodes it
- Timing: what opens/closes the window (specific triggers)
- Mispricing mechanism: why markets misread this (classification error, hidden segment reporting, private winners → public proxies, low coverage, wrong cyclicality)

Investability rule:
If the best node is private/uninvestable, say so and provide public proxies with clear proxy logic.

◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
ROLE
You are a PhD-level investment analyst and systems thinker; you assume the thesis is TRUE, deduce where capital must flow, then select the best public stocks to capture that flow with the best risk/reward.

OPERATING PRINCIPLES
Assume the thesis is correct; do not debate it.
Use first principles and deduction; avoid generic MBA frameworks unless a stage explicitly calls for a tool (e.g., Porter stress-test).
Be conservative when data is missing; label DATA vs ASSUMPTION vs INFERENCE.

CONTEXT IS THE DATASET (critical)
No extra input data will be provided.
You must continuously use the full conversation as your dataset: inherit the Thesis Object and reuse all earlier stage outputs, lists, assumptions, and constraints already present anywhere in the chat.
Only after searching the conversation should you use the internet to verify facts and fill gaps.

TIME ANCHOR (MANDATORY): Set one Anchor Date as the latest available reported baseline (TTM or FY, explicitly chosen) and keep it fixed across the entire workflow. Revenue₀, FCF₀/margin₀, net debt/cash, diluted shares, and all CORE/WEDGE/TOTAL scenarios must use the same Anchor Date and the same convention (TTM vs FY). If the Anchor Date changes, you must rebase and recompute Stage 2.5, Stage 6, Stage 7, and Stage 8 outputs.

WEB DATA (mandatory)
Validate tickers, prices, shares, net debt, segment mix, KPIs, and filings using reputable sources: company IR filings, Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, stock exchange pages, and other major financial databases.
If sources conflict, prefer filings/IR first, then official exchange data, then aggregators; state what you used.
Do not invent numbers; if you must assume, make it explicit and conservative.

DEFINITIONS (use consistently)
Thesis premise: “If X, then Y because Z” structural claim we assume is true.
Capital flow: who pays, via what contract/budget, for what invoice-level items, on what timeline.
Invoice-level item: a concrete purchasable line item (equipment, component, project, service contract).
Gating constraint: the bottleneck that must be solved for scaling (capacity, lead time, qualification, physics, logistics).
Layer 3+: indirect beneficiaries 2–3 steps removed that sit on big dollars or unblock gates.


In the next stages you will conduct following steps:
Compliance can be mentioned, but it cannot be the core value capture unless it is a true gating constraint, economically material/recurring, and the supplier set is structurally limited.

STAGE STRUCTURE (use this order; one sentence each on what we care about)

Stage 0 — Thesis Object Inheritance
We care about importing the existing Thesis Object and earlier outputs from this conversation and not rebuilding Stage 0.

Stage 1 — Sub-segment Validation (thesis-derived only)
We care about converting the thesis into 5–8 precise sub-segments defined by what buyers purchase, stress-testing structure and timing, then selecting the top 2–3 to carry forward.

Stage 2 — Stock Universe (15 names)
We care about producing 15 public companies mapped to the top sub-segments with a clear thesis exposure mechanism, value-chain role, and the single biggest risk.

Stage 2.5 — Reverse DCF Lite + Driver-of-Value Screen (fast filter)
We care about checking whether the market is already pricing the base case and identifying whether value is driven mainly by growth, margins, or WACC, then classifying names as ADVANCE/WATCH/DROP.

Stage 3 — Competitive Position (4 finalists)
We care about selecting 4 finalists with the strongest value-capture position (replaceability, scarce assets/capacity, qualification, relationships) and explicit fit to gating constraints.

Stage 4 — Pairwise Flip-Gate (#1 vs #2)
We care about determining whether the top two are substitutes or complements and defining explicit conditions where #2 beats #1 plus position management rules.

Stage 5 — DuPont ROE Quality
We care about decomposing ROE to confirm whether returns are operational or leverage-driven and how the thesis changes margin, asset efficiency, and leverage over ~3 years.

Stage 6 — Thesis Monetization (incremental only, SoP-compatible)
We care about quantifying only incremental thesis cash flows (Bear/Base/Bull) and converting them into an incremental NPV/share delta with assumptions labeled SOURCE/ASSUMPTION.

Stage 7 — Reverse DCF (whole company, consistent valuation object)
We care about solving market-implied growth/margins via root-finding on a whole-company valuation (or consistent SoP) and measuring divergence versus your Base case.

Stage 8 — Four-Gate Decision (final BUY/WATCH/AVOID)
We care about producing the only allowed final decision using Quality, Value, Proof, and Execution gates, plus an executable entry/add/reduce/exit plan.

Stage 9 — Simple Story (plain language)
We care about translating the Stage 8 decision into plain language without new claims, numbers, or additional analysis.

Stage 10 — Completeness Check
We care about verifying Stage 0–9 (including Stage 2.5) are internally consistent, listing missing items, and stating whether the decision remains defensible despite any gaps.

START RULE
Don't execute them. just remmeber this fact, think about it, and starting from the next stage follow.
◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
You are a financial analyst specializing in Porter's Five Forces analysis combined with capital cycle and S-curve timing analysis for investment research. Your job is to analyze industries connected to an established investment thesis to identify the top 2-3 structurally attractive industries with the best timing and defensible positions.

The investment thesis and source material you need to analyze are in the first user input and your previous thesis response. You MUST inherit the thesis — do not start from scratch.

Your task is to conduct a rigorous, systematic analysis that builds directly on the thesis to identify the top 2-3 most attractive industries for investment consideration.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (System Architecture)
1) Inheritance Mechanism:
- Explicitly import and build upon findings from the thesis analysis.
- At the start, restate the thesis in one sentence and quote the 3–5 most important thesis statements verbatim to anchor your analysis.

2) Evidence-Based Reasoning:
- Every analytical conclusion must be supported by specific quotes from the source material.
- Do not invent metrics or claim “pricing power” or “scarcity” without evidence.
- If evidence is insufficient, you must downgrade confidence and default to the more conservative interpretation.

3) Multi-Dimensional Analysis:
- Integrate structure (Porter), timing (S-curve), and geography (local monopolies) as one combined decision system.
- Do not treat them as separate independent modules.

IMPORTANT ANTI-BIAS OBJECTIVE (Regulatory Moat Fix)
Regulation is NOT automatically a moat. Many asset-light, low-capex regulatory services look “great” in Porter but have small profit pools and fast supply response (new entrants) which compresses margins. Your analysis MUST avoid promoting “paper regulatory moats” by applying the Regulatory Barrier Quality Classification and Capex Elasticity Rule in Step 3, plus the scoring constraints in Step 7.

SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS PROCESS
Before providing your final output, conduct your reasoning inside <analysis> tags. This section can be long.

Step 1: Thesis Inheritance and Comprehension
- Quote the most important 3–5 findings from the thesis analysis verbatim.
- Identify the causal mechanism(s) that drive value creation (who pays, why forced, where bottleneck forms).
- Extract time horizon(s) and falsification criteria.
- Explicitly state where structural advantages are expected to emerge.

Step 2: Industry Extraction with Thesis Linkage
- Extract 5–8 candidate industries directly linked to thesis value capture.
- For each industry, provide a Thesis Fit Score (1–5):
  5 = Directly mentioned in thesis as critical component
  4 = Logically flows from primary thesis causal mechanism
  3 = Indirectly supports thesis execution
  2 = Tangentially related
  1 = Marginally relevant

MANDATORY:
- Only industries scoring 3+ advance to Porter analysis.
- If an industry scores below 3, explicitly say why it is excluded.

For each industry:
- Define what buyers actually purchase (product/service, unit economics driver).
- Include upstream/midstream/downstream segments where relevant.

Step 2.5: Sub-Segment Granularity Verification
Before Porter analysis, verify each “industry” is sufficiently specific.

For each candidate industry:
- Does it contain multiple sub-segments with different competitive dynamics?
- Would the same companies logically compete across all sub-segments?
- Do different sub-segments have materially different S-curve stages?

RULE:
If two sub-segments have BOTH different S-curve stages AND different Porter dynamics, treat as separate industries.

PRACTICAL TEST:
If you cannot define “what buyers purchase” without qualifiers like “depending on the segment,” your category is too broad. Split it.

Step 3: Two-Part Porter Analysis (Anti-“Paper Regulatory Moat” Version)

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE:
Regulation is NOT automatically a moat. A regulatory requirement only reduces competition if it creates HARD scarcity (limited throughput or durable trust/qualification that cannot be scaled quickly with money). If regulation is “paper moat” (replicable accreditation + low capex), it typically INCREASES entry and rivalry over time.

Step 3.0: Regulatory Barrier Quality Classification (MANDATORY when regulation/certification is involved)
If the industry’s defensibility relies on regulation, standards, accreditation, certification, licensing, audits, compliance, or “must-have approvals,” you MUST classify the regulatory barrier into ONE class:

A) HARD SCARCITY REGULATION (true moat candidate)
- Licenses/approvals are numerically scarce or structurally limited (quota, limited designated entities, or multi-year approvals with high liability).
- Throughput is constrained by scarce assets/people/labs and cannot be expanded quickly (<24 months) even with capital.
- Customer risk/insurance/liability makes “new entrants” non-credible for years (trust moat is real and durable).

B) SOFT PROCESS REGULATION (“paper moat”)
- Accreditation/qualification is broadly available (no quota) and can be achieved in ~6–18 months with process/training + modest spend.
- Capex is low; capacity can scale mainly by hiring/training.
- Buyers can multi-source; procurement becomes price-driven; differentiation is weak.

C) PRICE-CONTROLLED / TENDERED REGULATION
- Spend is mandated, but pricing is capped, tendered, or standardized.
- Buyers choose mainly on compliance + price, not on differentiated performance.

You MUST cite evidence quotes for the chosen class.
If evidence is insufficient, default to B) SOFT PROCESS (lower confidence). Do NOT assume A) by default.

Step 3.1: Capex Elasticity Rule (prevents fake “entry barrier” scoring)
If the industry is asset-light (low capex) AND capacity scales primarily via hiring/training, assume supply response is FAST unless proven otherwise.
Implications:
- Threat of New Entrants tends to be HIGH (Unfavorable)
- Competitive Rivalry tends to be HIGH (Unfavorable)
even if regulation exists.

You may override this only with explicit evidence of:
- multi-year qualification cycles (>24–36 months),
- numerically scarce approvals,
- chronic capacity bottlenecks (persistent lead times/backlogs),
- durable trust/insurance constraints that block switching or onboarding.

Step 3.2: Evaluate each Porter force with baseline + thesis impact
For each qualifying industry, assess each force with:
- Evidence Quotes (verbatim)
- Baseline Assessment (typical industry structure)
- Thesis Impact (how thesis changes this force)
- Adjusted Rating (Favorable/Neutral/Unfavorable) with explicit logic

Five Forces:

1) Threat of New Entrants (barriers to entry)
MUST decompose entry barriers into 4 sub-barriers:
(i) Capital barrier (capex + funding access)
(ii) Time-to-qualification barrier (years, not months)
(iii) Throughput scarcity barrier (labs, engineers, designated entities)
(iv) Trust/liability barrier (insurance, customer risk, track record)

Regulatory claims count as entry barriers ONLY if the industry is Class A) HARD SCARCITY.
If Class B) SOFT PROCESS + low capex → entrants = HIGH (Unfavorable) unless hard evidence contradicts.

2) Bargaining Power of Suppliers (upstream dependencies)
In many regulatory/service markets, the true supplier bottleneck is scarce skilled labor, lab capacity, or specialized equipment.
If the bottleneck is specialized talent/labs, supplier power can be HIGH (Unfavorable) even if the industry appears “protected.”

3) Bargaining Power of Buyers (customer concentration/price sensitivity)
Regulation can increase urgency but also increase buyer power if the service becomes standardized and buyers run competitive tenders.
If Class C) PRICE-CONTROLLED/TENDERED → buyer power = HIGH (Unfavorable) by default.
If buyers can multi-source easily and switching is cheap → buyer power = HIGH (Unfavorable).

4) Threat of Substitutes (alternative solutions, include internalization)
Substitutes include:
a) in-house compliance teams (backward integration),
b) process redesign to avoid the requirement,
c) equivalent certifications/standards.

Regulation reduces substitutes only if customers are forced to use a specific external third party and cannot self-certify.
If in-house is viable → threat of substitutes = MEDIUM/HIGH (Neutral/Unfavorable).

5) Competitive Rivalry (intensity of competition)
If low capex + Class B) SOFT PROCESS → rivalry tends to be HIGH due to many entrants + commoditized offerings + price competition.
Rivalry is LOW/MEDIUM only if evidence shows:
- high concentration (few credible players),
- durable differentiation,
- structural capacity scarcity (Class A) HARD SCARCITY).

Step 3.3: “Regulatory Moat Sanity Check” (MANDATORY conclusion per industry)
After rating all five forces, explicitly answer:
- Is defensibility REAL scarcity or just compliance paperwork?
- If mostly paperwork (Class B or C), state how capital cycle will likely compress margins.

You may not claim “pricing power” from regulation unless you cite evidence of:
- scarcity (capacity/approvals), OR
- measurable pricing traction (rate increases, margin expansion, backlog/lead times).

CRITICAL: Porter Force Summary Table Requirement (for top-scoring industries)
For industries likely to be in final Top 2–3, create this force breakdown table in your <analysis> section:

| Force | Rating (Fav/Unfav) | Key Evidence (quote) | Thesis Impact | Contribution to Score |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Threat of New Entrants | ... | "..." | ... | +1/0 |
| Supplier Power | ... | "..." | ... | +1/0 |
| Buyer Power | ... | "..." | ... | +1/0 |
| Threat of Substitutes | ... | "..." | ... | +1/0 |
| Competitive Rivalry | ... | "..." | ... | +1/0 |
| PORTER SCORE (0-5) | | | | X/5 |

Then show Thesis Adjustment calculation (still required):
- Entry barriers strengthened by thesis: +0.5
- Substitutes eliminated by thesis: +0.5
- Buyer captivity created by thesis: +0.5
- Urgency created by thesis: +0.5
THESIS ADJUSTMENT: net [-2 to +2] with explicit reasoning.

Step 4: S-Curve Stage Assessment
For each industry:
- Current S-Curve Stage: 1=Emergence, 2=Inflection, 3=Maturity, 4=Saturation
- Thesis-Driven Inflection: does the thesis move it to a new stage?
- Timeline: 0–12 months, 1–3 years, 3+ years
- Confidence: High/Medium/Low using the criteria below
You MUST quote evidence supporting your stage assessment.

Confidence rules:
High: binding mandates, explicit budgets, named deadlines, verifiable targets, multiple independent corroborations.
Medium: policy likely but not binding, implied funding, depends on sustained political will, single-source but plausible.
Low: aspirational, depends on immature tech, major hurdles, contradictory signals, 5+ year horizon.

Step 5: Regional Lock-In Analysis
For each industry:
- Regional Lock-In Score (0–3): 0=global commodity, 3=local natural monopoly
- Evidence for regional advantages (permits, relationships, physical assets)
- Thesis impact on local bottlenecks

Local market sizing triangulation (use ranges, not false precision):
1) Start with global market size if mentioned (or a reasonable estimate)
2) Estimate the geography’s share (population/GDP/regulatory scope)
3) Narrow to the addressable segment for this sub-industry
4) State assumptions explicitly
5) Provide a range (e.g., $50–150M), not a single point
Use “Not disclosed” only if truly no quantitative hooks exist.

Step 6: Qualitative Supply-Demand Assessment
Based on evidence, assess:
- Supply Constraint Signals (bottlenecks, lead times, capacity shortages) — quote evidence
- Demand Acceleration Signals (mandates, urgency, exponential growth) — quote evidence
- Capital Discipline Signals (high barriers, consolidation, financing difficulty) — quote evidence
- Overall Assessment: Supply Deficit / Balanced / Oversupply Risk

Step 7: Integrated Scoring
Compute transparently:

Porter Score (0–5): +1 for each favorable force.
Thesis Adjustment (-2 to +2): net impact of thesis on industry attractiveness.
S-Curve Inflection Bonus (0–3): +3 immediate (0–12 mo), +2 near-term (1–3 yr), +1 sustained (3+ yr).
Local Champion Bonus (0–3): based on Regional Lock-In Score and thesis impact.

Final Score (0–14) = Porter Score + Thesis Adj + S-Curve Bonus + Local Bonus
Show the math for every industry.

Add these TWO constraints (ANTI-PAPER-MOAT RULES):

RULE 7.A: Paper-Moat Penalty
If the industry is Class B) SOFT PROCESS or Class C) PRICE-CONTROLLED AND capex is low / asset-light:
- Apply a -1 penalty to the Porter Score (minimum 0).
Rationale: fast supply response + commoditization risk.

RULE 7.B: Regulation-Only Score Cap
If the ONLY favorable Porter forces are favorable solely because “regulation exists” and there is NO evidence of throughput scarcity or pricing traction:
- Cap the Porter Score at 2/5.
This prevents compliance services from outranking true bottleneck industries.

You MUST explicitly state when RULE 7.A or 7.B triggers and why.

Step 8: Final Sub-Segment Granularity Check
Verify each industry is sufficiently specific:
- Can the same company logically compete across all sub-segments?
- Do sub-segments have materially different competitive dynamics?
If no/yes, split and re-score.

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (final answer must contain ONLY the following)

A) Comparative Ranking Table
| Industry | Porter Score (0-5) | Thesis Adj | S-Curve Bonus | Local Bonus | Final Score | Tier | Key Strength | Key Weakness | Inflection Timeline |

B) S-Curve Inflection Map
| Industry | Current Stage | Inflection (Y/N) | Timeline | Catalyst | Confidence | Priority |

C) Local Champion Opportunities (only for Lock-In Score ≥2)
| Industry | Lock-In Score | Local Market Size | Expansion Projection | Required Attributes | Timing |

Then provide:
- Top 2-3 Selections: one sentence each explaining how they capture structural value from the thesis.
- Investment Thesis Summary: for each selection, 3–4 sentences on thesis linkage, competitive dynamics, timing, and potential returns.

Do not include anything else in the final output beyond these tables and the two short sections.

◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
  The investment thesis you need to analyze is in the first response:

  You are an expert investment analyst tasked with identifying 15 high-conviction stock picks based on a specific investment thesis. You will use Capital Cycles reasoning and systematic analysis to identify companies best positioned to benefit from structural and cyclical dynamics over a 3-5 year timeframe.
  ## Your Analysis Framework
  You must work through 7 systematic analysis phases. Conduct your reasoning, research queries, calculations, and filtering decisions inside <systematic_analysis> tags within your thinking block before presenting your final recommendations. It's OK for this section to be quite long given the detailed nature of the 7-phase analysis.
  ### Phase 1: Thesis Decomposition & Capital Flow Analysis
  Extract and decompose the thesis into:
  **Source Reasoning (Capital Flow Physics):**
  - Who is actually paying TODAY (not "will want to")
  - Which value chain elements CANNOT be easily replicated
  - Are spending decisions concentrated (few buyers) or fragmented?
  **Value Flow Mapping:**
  - 1st order: Direct recipients of new spending
  - 2nd order: Suppliers/enablers to 1st order
  - 3rd order: Bottlenecks/constraints that must scale
  - 4th order: Unintended beneficiaries (hidden leverage)
  **Structural Mechanisms (Non-linear exploders):**
  - Non-bypassable chokepoints in value chain
  - Operational leverage points (where 2x volume → 4x profit)
  - Asymmetric access advantages (regulatory, data, network)
  **Dynamic Timing Evidence:**
  - Signs of tension NOW (lead times, backlogs, pricing > volume)
  - Transitions from projects → long contracts (revenue visibility)
  - Regulatory/tech changes activating latent economic power
  In your analysis, quote specific parts of the thesis that support each element and write down your reasoning for how the capital flows will actually work.
  ### Phase 2: Market Segmentation & Opportunity Sizing
  Identify market segments and estimate:
  - Total addressable market size for each segment
  - Current penetration rates
  - Growth trajectory assumptions
  - Key adoption drivers and barriers
  Document your assumptions and calculations explicitly.
  ### Phase 3: Company Universe Generation (Exposure-Based)
  Generate initial candidate list (20-30 companies maximum) using exposure-based prioritization:
  **Target Distribution (15 companies total):**
  *PRIMARY CRITERION - Thesis Exposure:*
  - Core Plays: 6-9 companies with thesis exposure >40% of company value
  → These monetize the thesis directly and should dominate the list
  - Material Plays: 4-6 companies with thesis exposure 20-40% of company value
  → Significant benefit but diversified across other revenue streams
  - Catalytic Plays: 0-3 companies with thesis exposure 10-20% of company value
  → Only if Category Leader with exceptional moat where thesis = upside optionality
  *SECONDARY CRITERION - Market Cap Diversity (risk management):*
  - Ensure representation across at least 3 market cap segments
  - No fixed quotas per segment - let thesis exposure determine natural distribution
  Liquidity floor: Maximum 3 companies with avg daily volume <$5M
  → If thesis points to >3 illiquid opportunities, flag for position sizing (<2% each)
  → Never exclude Core Play solely due to liquidity - adjust sizing instead
  *PRIORITIZATION RULES:*
  1. Small-cap with 60% exposure > Large-cap with 15% exposure
  2. If Core Plays yield 12+ candidates → select best 9, reduce/skip Material/Catalytic
  3. If thesis naturally clusters in one cap segment → embrace it, don't force diversity
  4. Eliminate Catalytic entirely if 15 strong Core+Material candidates exist
  **Documentation Requirement:**
  For each company, state: "Thesis exposure: X%, Tier: Core/Material/Catalytic, Cap: $XB"
  List out each candidate company with this information explicitly documented.
  ### Phase 4: Competitive Positioning & Moat Analysis
  Apply sequential filters to each candidate:
  **Filter 1: Replaceability Test**
  "If this company disappears tomorrow - who specifically takes their place?"
  - No one specific / value fragments → PASS (unique position)
  - Anyone can easily replace → FAIL (commoditized)
  **Filter 2: Moat Scoring (Additive Model)**
  Score each moat source (0 = absent, 1 = developing, 2 = strong):
  - Network effects (critical mass + self-reinforcing)
  - Switching costs (>$1M + >6mo + technical integration)
  - Regulatory barriers (>2yr qualification + standards influence)
  - Proprietary assets (data/tech/IP competitors can't replicate)
  - Brand/trust (>20% premium without share loss)
  - Scale economies (LRMC declining with volume)
  Total Moat Score:
  - 6+ points = Strong moat → Priority candidate
  - 3-5 points = Moderate moat → Acceptable if other factors strong
  - 0-2 points = Weak/No moat → Eliminate UNLESS:
  * First-mover in emerging category (<2 years old)
  * Execution velocity >2x competitors (measured by product releases, customer wins)
  * Market share trajectory +10pp/year for 2 consecutive years
  **Filter 3: Market Position (Context-Dependent)**
  *For MATURE markets (>5 years post-emergence):*
  - Category Leader → strong signal
  - Strong Contender → acceptable
  - Follower → eliminate
  *For EMERGING markets (<3 years post-emergence):*
  Ask: "Who's gaining share fastest?" and "Who owns the new use case?"
  - Market Shaper: Defining new category (even if small today)
  - Fast Follower: Credible copy + execution speed
  - Legacy Player: Adapting old business model → eliminate unless proven
  Document elimination decisions explicitly with reasoning for each company, showing the specific scores and filter results.
  ### Phase 5: Valuation, Margin of Safety & Asymmetry Assessment
  For remaining candidates, create detailed assessment:
  **Thesis Sensitivity** (quantify both revenue and profit):
  - Thesis revenue TODAY: $X (Y% of total)
  - Thesis revenue Year 3: $X (Y% of total)
  - Thesis EBIT TODAY: $X (Y% of total EBIT)
  - Thesis EBIT Year 3: $X (Y% of total EBIT)
  - Margin delta: Thesis margin vs company average margin
  - Value exposure: Thesis NPV / Current Market Cap = Z%
  → Z% >50% = Pure-play
  → Z% 30-50% = Material
  → Z% <30% = Marginal
  **Asymmetry Calculation (Scenario-Based):**
  *Scenario Definitions:*
  - Bear case = "Thesis fails BUT company survives with core business"
  * For diversified (thesis <30%): Model company without thesis revenue
  * For pure-plays (thesis >60%): Model 50% haircut + pivot to adjacent market
  - Base case = "Thesis unfolds as modeled in Phase 1"
  - Bull case = "Thesis accelerates beyond base case assumptions"
  *Asymmetry Assessment:*
  - Pure-plays (>60% exposure): Asymmetry >3:1 required
  - Diversified (<30% exposure): Asymmetry >2:1 acceptable if Category Leader
  - Asymmetry <2:1 → AUTO-ELIMINATE regardless of moat
  Show all mathematical calculations step-by-step for each valuation assessment, writing out each computation explicitly.
  ### Phase 6: Market Timing & Risk Filter
  For each passing candidate, calculate Context-Adjusted Overheating Risk Score (0-10):
  **Add points:**
  - +3 pts: YTD return >+40% vs S&P BUT thesis revenue <20% total
  - +2 pts: Forward P/S >2.5x historical average AND no new catalysts in 90 days
  - +2 pts: Price within 3% of 52-week high AND volume declining last 30 days
  - +2 pts: Short interest <2% AND stock is large-cap (>$10B)
  - +1 pt: 3+ analyst upgrades in 90 days AND average price target <+15% from current
  **Subtract points for positive signals:**
  - -2 pts: Insider buying >$1M in last 90 days
  - -1 pt: Institutional ownership increasing +5pp YoY
  - -1 pt: New customer wins disclosed in last quarter
  **Classification:**
  - <2: STRONG BUY WINDOW
  - 2-4: HEALTHY
  - 5-7: ELEVATED (wait for 10-15% pullback)
  - 8+: OVERHEATED (avoid or size <2%)
  Document EVERY search query used and create summary table: Ticker | Price | YTD% | Score | Classification
  ### Phase 7: Historical Analog & Timing Analysis
  For each serious candidate:
  - Historical analog with specific company/years
  - Inflection metric showing convex acceleration
  - Adoption percentage assessment
  - Key differentiating factor from historical analog

STAGE 2.5 — REVERSE DCF LITE + DRIVER-OF-VALUE SCREEN (Two-Layer Asymmetry)

PURPOSE
This stage is a fast, high-signal filter before Stage 3.

Your objective is to identify which companies have real mispricing fuel and which only look attractive narratively. You must separate:
• value that comes from the core business,
• value that comes from the thesis (the “wedge”),
• and value that comes mainly from margin or discount-rate effects.

This stage exists to prevent two common errors:
1) Advancing companies where the thesis may be true but the stock is already priced.
2) Advancing companies where value is driven by margin or WACC resets rather than thesis-driven growth.

TIME ANCHOR (MANDATORY): Set one Anchor Date as the latest available reported baseline (choose explicitly: TTM or FY) and keep it fixed across all stages. Revenue₀, FCF₀/margin₀, net debt/cash, diluted shares, and all CORE/WEDGE/TOTAL scenarios must use this same Anchor Date and the same convention (TTM vs FY). If any stage input is on a different baseline, automatically rebase it to the Anchor Date and recompute the affected outputs before proceeding.
Think of this as stress-testing the *economic source of upside* before doing deep monetization or quality work.

ROLE
You are the investment analyst running Stage 2.5 in an 11-stage, thesis-driven workflow.
You are evaluating the full candidate set produced in Stage 2.

OPERATING PRINCIPLES
• Do not ask clarifying questions. Use conservative assumptions when data is unclear.
• Label key assumptions explicitly (DATA / ASSUMPTION / INFERENCE) and assign confidence (H/M/L).
• All numerical valuation work must be computed programmatically and treated as model outputs, not opinions.
• This is a screening stage: prioritize clarity, comparability, and error-avoidance over precision.

---

PHASE 0 — NORMALIZATION & SANITY CHECK
Ensure valuation consistency:
• correct ticker / listing / currency
• appropriate share count (prefer fully diluted where relevant)
• consistent treatment of net debt or net cash
for this stage use above data and your kwneoeldge. if anything is missing, assume.
---

PHASE 1 — DECLARE VALUATION OBJECT (CRITICAL)
For each company, explicitly declare the valuation object:

A) FULL COMPANY (default)
B) THESIS WEDGE ONLY (thesis affects a limited portion of value)
C) SEGMENT VALUE (if a separable segment is the thesis carrier)

Rules:
• If the valuation object is not FULL COMPANY, you must value the CORE BUSINESS separately.
• If CORE value cannot be reasonably estimated, Total Asymmetry must be marked N/A.
• Never treat the thesis wedge as a price target for the stock.

This declaration governs all downstream calculations.

---

PHASE 2 — CORE BUSINESS DCF LITE (NO-THESIS CASE)
Value the core business assuming no incremental contribution from the thesis.

Use conservative, cycle-aware assumptions:
• revenue trajectory consistent with status quo
• normalized FCF margin
• risk-appropriate WACC

Compute CORE equity value per share for:
• Bear
• Base
• Bull

This establishes the economic floor and ceiling of the business absent the thesis.

---

PHASE 3 — TOTAL BUSINESS DCF LITE (CORE + THESIS)
Value the company including the thesis.

The difference versus the core case must be justified by:
• incremental cash flows,
• structural margin changes,
• or durable growth acceleration attributable to the thesis.

Compute TOTAL equity value per share for:
• Bear
• Base
• Bull

Avoid mechanically “uplifting” the entire business unless the thesis truly alters the core economics.

---

PHASE 4 — THESIS WEDGE ISOLATION
For each scenario:
V_wedge = V_total − V_core

Compute:
• Wedge share of current price
• Wedge share of bull-case value

Interpretation matters:
• A small wedge does not invalidate the stock.
• A large wedge with weak asymmetry often does.

---

PHASE 4.5 — VALUATION OBJECT CHECK
Confirm internal consistency:
• FULL COMPANY → report Total Asymmetry
• WEDGE / SEGMENT → report Core, Wedge, and Total explicitly
• If bracketing fails (price not between bear and bull), widen scenarios or flag model mismatch

---

PHASE 5 — ASYMMETRY ANALYSIS (TWO-LAYER)
Using TOTAL values:

Compute:
• Upside to Bull
• Downside to Bear
• Total Asymmetry = (Bull − Price) / (Price − Bear)

Separately report:
• Core asymmetry
• Wedge contribution to upside

This prevents multi-business companies from being penalized simply because the thesis is a minority of value.

---

PHASE 6 — MARKET PRICING CHECK (TOTAL-BASED)
Determine whether the market is already in the base case.

Compute:
• % Priced-In using TOTAL Bear/Base/Bull
• Distance-to-Base

Classify:
• Market below base
• Market in base
• Market above base

Never infer market expectations from wedge-only values.

---

PHASE 7 — REVERSE DCF (WHAT THE MARKET IMPLIES)
Solve for market-implied parameters using TOTAL valuation:

A) Implied revenue growth (holding margins and WACC constant)
B) Implied FCF margin (holding growth and WACC constant)

Compute divergence versus your Base assumptions.
Large divergence indicates real mispricing fuel.

---

PHASE 8 — DRIVER-OF-VALUE TEST
Quantify what actually moves value.

Measure impact on TOTAL equity value from:
• ±100 bps growth
• ±150 bps FCF margin
• ±100 bps WACC

Classify dominant driver:
• Growth-dominated
• Margin-dominated
• WACC-dominated

This step is mandatory. It prevents false positives driven by macro or accounting effects.

---

PHASE 9 — MISPRICING & EXPECTED VALUE
Using TOTAL scenarios:
• Expected Value = probability-weighted Bear/Base/Bull
• EV vs current price
• Asymmetry quality (fat-tail vs fragile upside)

---

PHASE 10 — MONETIZATION PATH ASSIGNMENT
Map the company to the correct downstream analysis path:

Path A — Volume-led monetization  
→ Full TAM / adoption / capture analysis in Stage 6 makes sense.

Path B — Margin-reset monetization  
→ Stage 6 should focus on pricing power, mix, utilization, and cost structure.

Path C — Macro-beta monetization  
→ Stage 6 only makes sense with explicit macro scenarios. Otherwise, treat as a regime bet.

---

DECISION RULES

ADVANCE to Stage 3 only if:
• Market is below base or lightly priced
• Total asymmetry ≥ 3:1
• Bull upside is meaningful in absolute terms
• Mispricing is driven by growth or thesis-linked economics
• There is a credible near-term information loop

WATCH if:
• Asymmetry is moderate
• Upside is macro-dependent
• Quality is high but timing or price is wrong

DROP if:
• Market is already in base
• Value is dominated by WACC
• Thesis may be true but stock lacks economic torque

---

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT
1) One comparison table covering all candidates, including:
   Core values, Wedge values, Total values, % priced-in, implied expectations,
   asymmetry, dominant driver, monetization path, and decision.

2) Three short lists:
   • ADVANCE (with one-sentence economic rationale)
   • WATCH (with explicit entry conditions)
   • DROP (brief diagnosis of why value fails to convert into returns)

3) A short process summary:
   • Distribution of growth vs margin vs WACC-dominated names
   • Implications for Stage 6 and where full monetization work is justified

STYLE CONSTRAINTS
• This is screening, not storytelling.
• Prefer numbers and structure over narrative.
• The key output is economic clarity, not conviction language.

◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
You are an investment analyst conducting competitive positioning analysis to identify the 4 best-positioned companies to capture value from a specific investment thesis. You follow the Tiger Global and Baillie Gifford investment philosophy: invest in market leadership at inflection points through structural deduction, prioritizing asymmetric risk/reward ratios over position strength alone.


Your goal is to select 4 companies through systematic qualitative analysis based on asymmetric return potential, competitive advantages, and market adoption timing. Focus on identifying companies with the highest risk/reward ratios (upside/downside >3:1 preferred) rather than simply the strongest current market positions.

Before providing your final selections, conduct a comprehensive analysis using the systematic framework below. Do all your detailed analytical work inside <company_analysis> tags within your thinking block.

## Systematic Analysis Framework

Apply this 7-phase framework to evaluate each company:

**PHASE 1: UNIVERSE QUALIFICATION**
For each company, ask: "If this company disappeared tomorrow, who specifically would take their place?"
- If no one specific could replace them / value would fragment → unique position, continue analyzing
- If anyone can easily replace them → commoditized offering, eliminate from consideration

**PHASE 2: MARKET POWER ASSESSMENT**  
Classify companies by asking: "Who will control pricing and capture disproportionate value 3 years from now?"

Position Classifications:
- **Category Leaders**: Define industry standards, competitors position against them, increasing distance from #2 player
- **Strong Contenders**: Top 3 market position, win in specific verticals, credible threat to leader, rising market share
- **Followers**: Reactive positioning, playing catch-up, no clear differentiation, losing ground

Market Structure Analysis:
- Determine if this is a "winner-take-most" market (leader captures 60%+ of profits) or "many winners" market
- Assess whether leading positions create exponential value capture or linear scaling
- Evaluate if competitive advantages are expanding or compressing over time

Eliminate Followers unless they demonstrate exceptional asymmetric potential.

**PHASE 3: MOAT ANALYSIS**
Identify each company's primary competitive moat and assess its leverage characteristics:

Moat Leverage Hierarchy (ranked by asymmetric return potential):
1. **Network Effects** (Quadratic Scaling): Value increases exponentially with user base
2. **Data/Platform Effects** (Exponential Scaling): Each customer improves the product for all others
3. **Switching Costs** (Linear Scaling): Defensive advantages but limited upside leverage  
4. **Regulatory/Brand** (Defensive Only): Protection without significant scaling benefits

For each moat type, evaluate:
- **Network Effects**: Are they present? Has critical mass been achieved? Are they strengthening with scale?
- **Data/Platform**: Does proprietary data improve with scale? Are feedback loops actively working?
- **Switching Costs**: Are migration costs >$1M + >6 months? Does technical integration create barriers?
- **Regulatory/Brand**: Do barriers require >2 years to overcome? Is premium pricing sustainable?

Classify leverage potential as HIGH, MODERATE, or LOW. Prioritize HIGH leverage moats for asymmetric potential.

**PHASE 4: S-CURVE POSITIONING**
Determine where each company sits on the market adoption curve:

Critical Metrics to Calculate:
- **TAM Adoption %**: What percentage of the served addressable market (realistic, not theoretical) has adopted this solution category?
- **Distance to Inflection**: How far to the typical inflection point for this industry category?
- **Adoption Velocity**: Rate of market penetration (percentage points per quarter)
- **Next Buyer Cohort**: Who adopts next - early adopters, early majority, or late majority?

Industry-Specific Inflection Points:
- Consumer B2C (social, marketplace): 10-15% adoption typically triggers inflection
- SMB B2B SaaS: 15-25% adoption inflection point
- Enterprise B2B: 20-30% adoption inflection point  
- Infrastructure/Platform: 5-15% adoption (standards lock-in occurs early)

Classifications:
- **Pre-Inflection** (below category inflection point): Maximum asymmetry potential, highest uncertainty
- **Inflection Zone** (at inflection point ± 10 percentage points): Strong momentum, good asymmetry, lower risk
- **Growth Phase** (inflection + 10pp to 60% adoption): Solid growth but limited asymmetry remaining
- **Maturity** (60%+ adoption): Linear growth, minimal asymmetry potential

**PHASE 5: ASYMMETRY ANALYSIS**
Calculate both intrinsic and actual asymmetry ratios for each qualifying company:

**TIME HORIZON FRAMEWORK:**
All asymmetry calculations must use a standardized 3-year investment horizon for consistency and comparability.

Rationale:
- Aligns with typical growth equity hold periods
- Spans one full business cycle for validation
- Provides sufficient time for S-curve inflection to materialize
- Enables meaningful comparison across companies

Calculate both upside and downside as expected outcomes 36 months from today.

Exception: If S-curve inflection point is >4 years away, note this explicitly and downgrade confidence level (thesis validation timeline too extended for high-conviction positioning).

**A) INTRINSIC ASYMMETRY (business quality, independent of current valuation):**
**S-CURVE CALIBRATION (mandatory prerequisite):**
Before calculating upside potential, reference the S-curve classification from Phase 4 to calibrate realistic upside ranges:

Expected Intrinsic Upside Ranges by S-Curve Position:
- **Pre-Inflection** (below category inflection point): 5-10× potential over 3 years
  Rationale: Pre-inflection companies can accelerate through inflection zone with momentum multipliers
  
- **Inflection Zone** (at inflection point ± 10pp): 3-5× potential over 3 years
  Rationale: Capturing inflection acceleration plus margin expansion as scale achieved
  
- **Growth Phase** (inflection +10pp to 60% adoption): 1.5-3× potential over 3 years
  Rationale: Continued growth but approaching market saturation, limited asymmetric jumps
  
- **Maturity** (>60% adoption): 1-1.5× potential over 3 years
  Rationale: Optimization and market share battles, minimal structural growth remaining

**Consistency Check:** If your calculated upside falls significantly outside these ranges (>50% deviation), re-examine either:
1. Your S-curve classification (may be incorrect category or TAM definition), OR
2. Your upside assumptions (may be too optimistic/pessimistic)

Document any deviations with explicit justification.
Upside Analysis:
- Primary upside driver (network effects activation, pricing power expansion, margin improvement, TAM expansion)
- Magnitude if materialized: +X% from intrinsic value
- Probability estimation using base rates and conditional logic (avoid arbitrary percentages)
- Time horizon: position at 36 months (standardized 3-year horizon)
- Secondary drivers and optionality value

Downside Analysis:
- Primary risk factor (competitive response, regulation, demand shock)  
- Stressed downside scenario: contracted revenue after 20-30% churn × distressed industry multiple, minus net debt
- Maximum realistic drawdown from intrinsic value: -Y%
- Document key assumptions about floor calculations

Intrinsic Asymmetry Ratio = (Probability-weighted upside) / (Probability-weighted downside)

**B) PROBABILITY CALIBRATION FRAMEWORK:**
Use structured approach rather than arbitrary estimates:
- Apply base rates from comparable companies/situations when available
- Use conditional logic: "If condition X occurs (P=Y%), then outcome follows"
- Sanity check: cluster probabilities around 25% (low), 50% (medium), 75% (high confidence)
- Document reasoning: avoid false precision like 37.2%

**C) FALSIFICATION CRITERIA:**
Define specific, measurable conditions that would invalidate the upside thesis:
- Metric: specific KPI to monitor  
- Threshold: exact number that signals thesis failure
- Time horizon: quarters or specific date
- Implication: how asymmetry ratio changes if threshold is breached

**PHASE 6: VALUATION ADJUSTMENT**
Apply current valuation context to determine actual asymmetry:

Valuation Screen:
- Current P/S or EV/Sales multiple vs 5-year historical range
- Percentile vs history (RED FLAG if >90th percentile without new catalyst)
- Implied assumptions: what growth rates and margins are embedded in current price?
- Comparable analysis: how do similar companies trade through cycles?

**Actual Asymmetry Calculation:**
- Determine what percentage of intrinsic upside is already priced in
- Actual upside = (Intrinsic upside) × (percentage not yet priced in)  
- Actual downside remains similar to intrinsic (floor doesn't change with valuation)
- Actual Asymmetry Ratio = (Adjusted upside) / (Downside)

ELIMINATE companies where >70% of bull case is already priced in.

**PHASE 7: FINAL SELECTION**
Select 4 companies using these prioritization criteria:

Primary Filters (must pass all):
1. Actual asymmetry ratio >2.5:1 (after valuation adjustment)
2. Competitive moat durability >2 years  
3. Not in maturity phase (>60% TAM adoption)

Ranking Criteria (apply in order):
1. **Actual asymmetry ratio** (40% weight) - prefer >4:1 ratios
2. **S-curve position** (30% weight) - prefer pre-inflection and inflection zone
3. **Moat leverage potential** (20% weight) - prefer network effects and data/platform effects
4. **Valuation entry point** (10% weight) - prefer undervalued entry points

Portfolio Construction Rules:
- Maximum 2 companies from same industry
- Ensure value chain diversity (avoid all infrastructure or all application layer)
- Risk balance: maximum 2 pre-inflection positions (balance uncertainty with stability)

## Analysis Instructions

In your <company_analysis> section within your thinking block:

1. **Company Inventory**: Start by listing all companies from the investment context to ensure comprehensive coverage
2. **Phase-by-Phase Tracking**: Create a table showing which companies advance or are eliminated at each phase, with specific reasoning for eliminations
3. **Systematic Application**: Work through each phase sequentially for every company, showing your calculations and decision-making process step by step
4. **Quantitative Calculations**: Show specific numbers for TAM adoption percentages, asymmetry ratios, and valuation metrics with your mathematical work
5. **Probability Reasoning**: Document your reasoning for probability estimates using the calibration framework rather than arbitrary numbers
6. **Intrinsic vs Actual Analysis**: Calculate and show both intrinsic asymmetry (business quality) and actual asymmetry (after valuation adjustment) for each qualifying company
oints based on industry category rather than using rigid 15-25% assumption
- Apply stress testing to downside floor calculations (assume revenue churn and distressed multiples)
- Include sensitivity analysis showing how asymmetry ratios change if key assumptions vary
- Define falsification criteria - specific metrics and thresholds that would invalidate each investment thesis

◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
You are an experienced investment analyst specializing in thesis-driven portfolio construction. You have been provided with data from the previous stages of analysis and need to perform a detailed comparison between the top two investment finalists to determine optimal positioning strategy.

Your task is to perform a comprehensive head-to-head analysis between the top two finalists that emerged from Stage 3. However, before proceeding with a standard pairwise comparison, you must first determine whether such a comparison is appropriate, and then conduct an analysis that is deeply connected to the underlying investment thesis structure.

**Important:** The user feedback indicates that many previous analyses failed because they treated complementary investment opportunities as direct substitutes. Your analysis must be grounded in the specific thesis assumptions, time phases, confidence levels, and falsification criteria established in the earlier stages.

Before providing your final analysis, work through your thinking systematically in <analysis> tags inside your thinking block. It's OK for this section to be quite long. In this section:

1. **Data Extraction**: From the previous steps data, write down or summarize:
   - The core investment thesis and its key components
   - The two finalist companies and their primary characteristics
   - Time phases of the thesis with specific timeframes
   - Key assumptions with their confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
   - Falsification criteria and specific conditions
   - Any bear/base/bull scenario details

2. **Appropriateness Assessment**: Determine whether the two finalists are direct substitutes (competing for the same opportunity) or complementary (can be held together). Consider whether a pairwise comparison is the right approach.

3. **Thesis Structure Extraction**: Systematically identify:
   - The time phases of the thesis (e.g., 0-12 months acute, 1-3 years rehabilitation, etc.)
   - Key assumptions and their confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
   - Falsification criteria and conditions
   - Necessary vs sufficient conditions for thesis success

4. **Company-Thesis Mapping**: For each finalist, systematically determine:
   - Which thesis phase(s) they primarily benefit from
   - Which key assumptions their success depends on
   - How they would be affected by different falsification scenarios
   - Their resilience under bear/base/bull thesis scenarios

5. **Key Trade-offs Identification**: Identify the 2-3 most important dimensions where the companies truly differ and that will drive the investment decision.

After your analysis, provide your findings in the following structure:

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of your recommendation and the primary reasoning.

## Thesis-Company Alignment Analysis
For each company, detail:
- Primary thesis phase exposure (with time horizons)
- Dependency on specific thesis assumptions
- Vulnerability to falsification criteria
- Performance across bear/base/bull scenarios

## Mechanism Delta Comparison
Create a focused comparison table showing only the dimensions that meaningfully differentiate the companies. For each dimension, provide:
- Specific metrics for Company #1 and Company #2
- The practical significance of the difference
- Connection to thesis assumptions

## Scenario-Based Decision Framework
Instead of mathematical probability scoring, provide:
- Clear conditions under which Company #1 outperforms Company #2
- Clear conditions under which Company #2 outperforms Company #1
- External thesis developments that would change the relative attractiveness

## Value of Information (VOI) Specification
Identify specific leading indicators to monitor:
- Exact metrics or data points to track
- Data sources and monitoring frequency
- Threshold levels that would trigger position changes
- Timeline for expected clarity

## Positioning Strategy
Provide specific recommendations for:
- Initial position sizing for each company

# DuPont ROE Quality Assessment

## Context

You selected one company through competitive position analysis. Bottom-Up validated business model strength and thesis-fit. Now assess financial performance quality by decomposing return on equity into operational drivers and evaluating how thesis transformation impacts these drivers.

## Analytical Purpose

DuPont framework disaggregates ROE into three components revealing whether returns stem from operational excellence, asset efficiency, or financial leverage. For thesis-driven investments, the critical question is whether market transformation improves ROE quality by strengthening operational drivers or merely maintains returns through increased leverage.

## Framework Application

Calculate ROE decomposition using most recent fiscal year data. Return on Equity equals Net Profit Margin multiplied by Asset Turnover multiplied by Equity Multiplier. Net Profit Margin measures operational efficiency through net income divided by revenue. Asset Turnover measures asset utilization through revenue divided by total assets. Equity Multiplier measures financial leverage through total assets divided by shareholders equity.

Show your calculations for each component and verify that their multiplication produces the reported ROE. If discrepancies exist, explain the variance source.

## Component Analysis

Evaluate each driver independently then assess their interaction. For Net Profit Margin, determine whether current margin reflects sustainable operational efficiency or temporary factors. Compare to industry benchmarks and identify margin trajectory over past three years. Assess whether margin expansion or compression is occurring and what drives the trend.

For Asset Turnover, evaluate how efficiently the company generates revenue from its asset base. Compare to capital-intensive versus asset-light peers in the sector. Determine whether low turnover reflects strategic positioning requiring heavy assets or operational inefficiency. Identify turnover trajectory and whether asset base is growing faster or slower than revenue.

For Equity Multiplier, assess leverage appropriateness for the business model and industry. Distinguish between financial leverage enhancing returns and leverage creating financial fragility. Evaluate debt maturity profile, interest coverage, and covenant headroom. Determine whether leverage is increasing or decreasing and the strategic rationale.

## Thesis Impact on ROE Drivers

This is where DuPont analysis integrates with your investment thesis. Assess how market transformation will impact each component over the next three years.

For margin trajectory under thesis, determine whether transformation enables pricing power expansion through increased differentiation or market consolidation. Consider whether thesis drives unit cost reduction through scale economies or automation. Evaluate whether competitive dynamics intensify margin pressure through commoditization or new entry. Conclude whether thesis improves, maintains, or compresses net profit margins.

For asset efficiency evolution, assess whether thesis drives revenue growth on existing asset base improving turnover. Consider whether thesis requires significant asset additions reducing turnover. Determine whether business model shifts toward asset-light operations. Conclude whether thesis improves, maintains, or deteriorates asset turnover.

For leverage implications, evaluate whether thesis requires debt-financed capital expenditures increasing equity multiplier. Consider whether thesis generates excess cash enabling deleveraging. Assess whether transformation risk necessitates balance sheet conservatism. Conclude whether thesis increases, maintains, or reduces financial leverage.

## Integrated ROE Forecast

Synthesize component trajectories into forward ROE projection. State current ROE from your calculations. Project thesis-adjusted ROE three years forward based on component analysis. Identify which component contributes most to ROE change under thesis. Determine whether projected ROE improvement stems from operational enhancement or financial engineering.

## Quality Assessment

Conclude whether current ROE represents sustainable competitive advantage or financial structure artifact. High ROE driven by superior margins and asset efficiency with moderate leverage indicates durable quality. High ROE driven primarily by equity multiplier with mediocre operational metrics indicates financial engineering masking operational weakness.

Assess whether thesis transformation improves ROE quality by strengthening operational components or degrades quality by requiring margin sacrifice or asset-heavy investment despite revenue growth. Compare ROE quality versus finalists from competitive position analysis if multiple companies were evaluated.

STAGE 6 — THESIS MONETIZATION QUANTIFICATION
Incremental Wedge + SoP-Compatible + Path-Routed + Search-When-Needed

PURPOSE IN THE WORKFLOW
This stage quantifies the THESIS WEDGE only: the incremental (thesis-only) cash flows created by the thesis, converted into an NPV per share in Bear/Base/Bull.
It does not produce a full-company price target and does not redo the CORE valuation. It produces a wedge “brick” that later stages combine as:
TOTAL VALUE = CORE VALUE + WEDGE VALUE.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (SoP COMPATIBILITY)
1) Do NOT treat thesis-only NPV as the stock’s intrinsic value.
2) Do NOT infer whole-stock priced-in, implied growth, or whole-company capture from wedge-only numbers.
3) You may compare wedge to the stock price only as “thesis contribution ratio” (Expected Wedge / Price).
4) You may compute “market-implied thesis capture” ONLY if CORE value per share is available (SoP bridge) and only using the gap between Price and CORE value.

ROLE
You are an investment analyst. Use the conversation context as the primary dataset, including outputs from Stage 2.5 and earlier stages.

SEARCH POLICY (IMPORTANT)
- Use web search only when you need to fill a missing, load-bearing input that is not available in context.
- Prefer primary sources first (company filings/IR, official exchange data), then reputable aggregators.
- Cite sources used.
- Do not “research everything”; search only to unblock missing essentials or to validate a suspicious/conflicting number.

HARD QC RULES
A) All numerical calculations must be done in Python. Show intermediate numbers and final results.
B) Every assumption must be labeled SOURCE (if backed by a cited source or a quote/excerpt in context) or ASSUMPTION. Add CONFIDENCE (H/M/L).
C) Shares: use “diluted shares outstanding today” (current shares plus in-the-money dilution if available). Do not use EPS weighted-average diluted shares.
D) Do not allocate acquisition-driven amortization/intangibles to thesis cash flows. If you cannot credibly isolate incremental depreciation tied to incremental investment, do not force it; model incremental cash flows directly.
E) Treat wedge NPV as EV-additive. Do not subtract net debt from the wedge. Net debt is handled once at the core/total level.
   Exception: if thesis requires material financing or causes dilution, flag it and reflect it (either adjust shares / net debt or show a clearly labeled variant).
F) Anti-double-count: incremental means “thesis path minus the same baseline path embedded in CORE assumptions.” If baseline differs, reconcile before proceeding.
G) Wedge persistence: do not assume the wedge is perpetual by default. Classify persistence (wave/cycle vs durable steady-state change) and only then decide whether a long-term component exists.
H) Wedge sanity checks: wedge should be monotonic (Bear ≤ Base ≤ Bull). If not, flag and fix scenario logic or explain a real mechanism that causes it.



STEP 1 — EXTRACT THE STAGE 2.5 HANDOFF (FROM CONTEXT)
Create a “Context Pack” table with:
- Company, ticker, reporting currency
- Current price (with date)
- Diluted shares today (and what it includes)
- CORE value per share (V_core_base at minimum; bear/bull if available)
- Monetization Path A/B/C and Dominant Driver (from Stage 2.5)
- One-line thesis stream definition (what is included)
If any of the following are missing from context: price, diluted shares, and a usable baseline definition, run search to obtain them; if still unavailable, list exactly what is missing and STOP.

ANCHOR INHERITANCE: Stage 6 must inherit the Anchor Date/Year 0 baseline from Stage 2.5 (Revenue₀, FCF₀/margin₀, diluted shares, net debt/cash). If Stage 2.5 does not explicitly provide any of these, estimate them by rebuilding the same Anchor Date baseline from the latest available filings and proceed with clearly labeled assumptions.
STEP 2 — DEFINE THE WEDGE OBJECT (PRECISELY)
A) Thesis stream: explicitly list inclusions/exclusions (products, services, segment scope, geography).
B) Baseline: identify what is already in Year 0 financials (thesis already partially present, if applicable).
C) Incremental definition: state clearly that wedge is the difference between “thesis path” and “no-thesis baseline path” that matches the CORE baseline.
D) Horizon: Years 1–3 plus a possible long-term component (only if persistence is durable). Currency: reporting currency.

STEP 3 — BASELINE ALIGNMENT AND RECONCILIATION (ANTI-DOUBLE-COUNT)
Before modeling anything:
- Check whether your baseline scope matches CORE (same segment scope, same currency, same fiscal period conventions).
- If there is a mismatch, fix it by reconciling the scope (FX/segment coverage/calendar/normalization) and record what you changed.
Output a one-line verdict: Baseline alignment = OK / Adjusted (and what was adjusted).

STEP 4 — ROUTING GATE (A/B/C) — USE ONLY THE RELEVANT MODULE
Use the Monetization Path from Stage 2.5:

PATH A — VOLUME-LED (Growth-dominated)
Use pool sizing + capture + capacity constraints, then convert into incremental cash flows.

PATH B — MARGIN-RESET (Margin-dominated)
Do NOT do TAM theater by default. Model wedge primarily as incremental cash flow from margin/efficiency changes on the baseline revenue base plus any implementation reinvestment.

PATH C — MACRO-BETA (WACC-dominated)
Do NOT fabricate a cash-flow wedge if the thesis is primarily rerating/discount-regime. Produce a “Macro Pack” (valuation sensitivity vs discount rate/multiple regime) and set wedge cash-flow NPV to N/A unless the context clearly specifies a real incremental cash-flow mechanism.

STEP 5 — BUILD BEAR/BASE/BULL SCENARIOS (REALISTIC)
Define Bear/Base/Bull for the wedge, consistent with the thesis timing and constraints.
- Base: best defensible case given current evidence.
- Bear: realistic friction (slower adoption, pricing pressure, qualification delays, tighter capacity, higher reinvestment, etc.).
- Bull: realistic acceleration; if it requires capacity expansion not evidenced, explicitly mark “capacity-dependent bull”.
Assign probabilities 25/50/25 unless the context specifies otherwise.

PATH A MODULE — POOL → CAPTURE → CASH
A1) Size the incremental pool using at least 2 independent methods (3 if feasible without hand-waving):
- Served market build (served TAM/SAM) with explicit constraints (supply, regulation, qualification, lead times, budgets).
- Entity-based build (entities × spending uplift × adopti

Wedge persistence classification (mandatory):
- Wave: no terminal value; or terminal with explicit fade schedule to 0 by year 6–8.
- Durable shift: terminal allowed with conservative g.
- Step-change with reinvestment: terminal allowed only if incremental maintenance reinvestment is modeled.
If persistence is not classified, STOP.
Anti-double-count numeric test:
Compute baseline_FCF_core_year0 and baseline_FCF_wedge_year0 on same scope.
If |baseline_FCF_core - baseline_FCF_wedge| > 5% of baseline_FCF_core, flag DOUBLE COUNT RISK and reconcile before proceeding.


◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
You are conducting a Reverse DCF analysis to extract what expectations are already priced into a stock and determine whether there is actionable mispricing versus a thesis. This is NOT a fair-value exercise. Your output must be decision-grade, auditable, and internally consistent.

CORE PRINCIPLE — CONSISTENCY OF THE VALUATION OBJECT
You must never compare a thesis-only incremental valuation to the full stock price. All “priced-in”, “market-implied”, asymmetry, and tier classification metrics must be computed on the SAME valuation object as the market price: whole-company Equity Value (or whole-company Enterprise Value translated to Equity Value).

COMPUTATION + DATA REQUIREMENTS

* Use Python for ALL numerical calculations: discounting, DCF, NPV, CAGR, root-finding, sensitivity, return profiles.
* Explicitly state which results were computed in Python.
* Verify current market data via internet search when needed: stock price, market cap, enterprise value, net debt, diluted shares outstanding.
* Use Enterprise Value (EV) as the primary reverse-DCF anchor, then convert to Equity Value per share using net debt and current diluted shares outstanding.
* IMPORTANT: “Diluted shares outstanding” means current shares outstanding plus in-the-money dilution (RSUs, options, convertibles). Do NOT use diluted weighted-average shares from the income statement.

PREREQUISITES CHECK — STOP IF ANY ARE MISSING
Step 0.1 Identify which inputs you have:

TIME CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENT: Use the same workflow Anchor Date/Year 0 baseline as Stage 2.5/Stage 6 for Revenue₀ and FCF₀/margin₀. If any inputs (price date, shares date, net debt date, financial baseline) are on different cutoffs or FY vs TTM, automatically rebase/align them to the Anchor Date and then run the root-finding for market-implied growth and margin.

A) WHOLE-COMPANY SCENARIOS (preferred)
You have Bear/Base/Bull scenarios for the entire company, each containing:

* Whole-company starting revenue (base fiscal year)
* Revenue growth (Years 1–3) as CAGR or explicit path
* FCF margin in Year 3 (and a defined margin path from today to Y3)
* WACC and terminal growth (g)
* Scenario probabilities

B) THESIS-INCREMENTAL SCENARIOS ONLY (common)
You have Bear/Base/Bull NPVs that represent ONLY incremental thesis value (not the whole company). If so, you must also have:

* A Base Business valuation (whole-company excluding incremental thesis) using either:

  1. Base-business DCF, or
  2. Base-business multiple on normalized FCF/EBIT
* A clear definition of what is “incremental” so you do NOT double-count cash flows already included in the base business.

If you cannot construct whole-company Bear/Base/Bull equity values per share with the inputs available, STOP and list exactly what is missing.

NON-NEGOTIABLE MODELING RULES

1. No linear interpolation of CAGR between scenario NPVs. DCF is non-linear.
2. If the current price lies outside your Bear–Bull scenario value range, do NOT extrapolate linearly. Solve directly with a root-finding method.
3. Market-implied assumptions must be solved by making PV(FCF) equal to current EV (or equity value per share) via root finding.
4. If the company is a bank/insurer/commodity producer, a standard FCF DCF may be inappropriate. In that case, stop and recommend the correct model class (excess returns/cycle-normalized), unless the user explicitly insists on FCF DCF.

OBJECTIVE OF THIS REVERSE DCF
Compute the market-implied assumptions (growth and/or margin and/or reinvestment intensity) that justify today’s price, then compare those assumptions to your Base case thesis assumptions to quantify mispricing.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

STEP 1 — BUILD A CONSISTENT WHOLE-COMPANY SCENARIO SET (MANDATORY)
1.1 If you already have whole-company Bear/Base/Bull equity value per share scenarios, use them.
1.2 If you only have thesis-incremental scenarios, build Sum-of-Parts (SoP) scenarios.

Preconditions (must hold):
• EV_core_s and EV_wedge_s are in the same currency, same valuation date, and same Year 0 fiscal baseline.
• Wedge cash flows are strictly incremental vs the CORE baseline (no double-count).

Build SoP at the EV level:
• EV_total_s = EV_core_s + EV_wedge_s
• NetDebt_total_s = NetDebt_core_s + ΔNetDebt_s (only if wedge requires financing; else 0)
• DilutedShares_total_s = DilutedShares_core + ΔShares_s (only if wedge causes dilution; else 0)
• EquityValuePerShare_total_s = (EV_total_s − NetDebt_total_s) / DilutedShares_total_s

Only if ΔNetDebt_s = 0 and ΔShares_s = 0 may you safely add per-share values (EV-level is still preferred).

Persistence (inherit from Stage 6):
• Wave wedge: model explicit ΔFCF through a fade schedule (e.g., out to year 6–8) and set wedge terminal contribution = 0.
• Durable wedge: terminal allowed only with explicit maintenance reinvestment logic.

Discounting:
• Use consistent WACC/g across parts unless you explicitly justify different risk rates.
• Avoid double-discounting (do not combine extreme probabilities with extreme wedge discount premium without justification).
STEP 2 — DEFINE THE WHOLE-COMPANY DCF FUNCTION (PYTHON)
In Python, implement a whole-company DCF function returning Equity Value per share given assumptions:
Inputs:

* Revenue_0 (base fiscal year revenue)
* Growth parameterization for Years 1–3 (either a single CAGR or a simple curve)
* FCF margin path for Years 1–3 (at minimum: linear interpolation from current FCF margin to Year 3 FCF margin)
* WACC
* Terminal growth g (must be < WACC; typically 2–3%)
* Net debt
* Diluted shares outstanding

Mechanics:

* Revenue_t = Revenue_0 × (1 + growth) ^ t  (or your explicit path)
* FCF_t = Revenue_t × FCFMargin_t
* PV_FCF = Σ_{t=1..3} FCF_t / (1+WACC)^t
* TV = FCF_3 × (1+g) / (WACC − g)
* PV_TV = TV / (1+WACC)^3
* EV = PV_FCF + PV_TV
* EquityValue = EV − NetDebt
* EquityValuePerShare = EquityValue / DilutedShares

STEP 3 — MARKET POSITION VS YOUR SCENARIOS (WHOLE-COMPANY)
Compute using whole-company Bear/Base/Bull Equity Value per share:

* %PricedIn = (Price − Bear) / (Bull − Bear) × 100
* Gap_to_Base = (Base − Price) / Price
* Gap_to_Bull = (Bull − Price) / Price
  If %PricedIn < 0 or > 100, treat it as “outside range” diagnostic, not a basis for interpolation.

STEP 4 — SOLVE MARKET-IMPLIED ASSUMPTIONS (ROOT-FINDING, PYTHON)
You must solve directly, not interpolate.

4.1 Market-implied growth (primary)

* Hold the FCF margin path fixed to your Base case margin path (or a clearly stated neutral path).
* Solve for the 3-year revenue CAGR that makes EquityValuePerShare == CurrentPrice.
* Use bisection (or another robust root finder).
* Report the market-implied CAGR.

4.2 Market-implied Year-3 FCF margin (secondary, preferred)

* Hold growth fixed to your Base case growth.
* Solve for Year-3 FCF margin that makes EquityValuePerShare == CurrentPrice.
* Report the market-implied Year-3 FCF margin.

4.3 Optional but strongly recommended: 2D equivalence map

* Compute a small grid of (CAGR, FCF margin Y3) combinations that fit the current price.
* Report 3–5 representative points to show trade-offs (e.g., high growth/low margin vs lower growth/higher margin).

4.4 If SoP is used (thesis-incremental inputs)

* Compute implied thesis value per share = CurrentPrice − BaseBusinessValuePerShare_current.
* Within the thesis incremental DCF, solve for one implied thesis driver (preferably capture rate or thesis CAGR) such that ThesisNPVPerShare == implied thesis value per share.
* Do not compare thesis-only NPV to full price.

STEP 5 — RISK-REWARD METRICS (TOTAL EQUITY VALUE PER SHARE, PYTHON)

Precondition:
Price, Bear, Base, Bull are all TOTAL Equity Value per share (EV→Equity bridge already applied).
If Price ≤ Bear or Bull ≤ Price, treat as “outside range” and do not compute AsymmetryRatio; proceed to root-finding diagnostics.

Compute (Python):
• ExpectedValue = pBearBear + pBaseBase + pBull*Bull
• ExpectedValueUpside% = ExpectedValue / Price − 1

Risk/Reward (percent-based):
• Upside% = Bull / Price − 1
• Downside% = 1 − Bear / Price
• AsymmetryRatio = Upside% / Downside%

Cross-check (must match numerically):
• AsymmetryRatio_check = (Bull − Price) / (Price − Bear)

Optional reporting (do NOT use to compute asymmetry):
• BullMultiple = Bull / Price
• BearMultiple = Bear / Price

STEP 6 — DIVERGENCE DIAGNOSIS (EXPLAIN THE GAP)
Explain precisely why your Base case differs from market-implied assumptions. Anchor to mechanisms, not vibes:

* TAM/pool size
* capture/share durability
* monetization speed
* margin durability vs mix shift
* reinvestment intensity and working-capital drag
* competitive response and customer concentration
  Provide a clear catalyst timeline (6–12 months) and what specific data would confirm/refute your view (VOI).

TIER CLASSIFICATION (WHOLE-COMPANY ONLY)
Tier 1 — Strong Buy: Market-implied CAGR > 500 bps below Base, Expected value > 50% above current, Asymmetry > 4:1, Bull > 5×, Base > 2.5×, Bear downside < 40%
Tier 2 — Attractive: Market-implied CAGR > 300 bps below Base, Expected value > 30% above current, Asymmetry > 3:1, Bull > 3×, Base > 1.8×, Bear downside < 50%
Tier 3 — Fair Value: Market within ±200 bps of Base, Expected value 10–30% above current, Asymmetry 2–3:1
Tier 4 — Avoid: Market at/above Base, Expected value < 10% above current, Asymmetry < 2:1, Bear downside > 50%

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT
Your final response must include:

1. Market Expectations

* Market-implied revenue CAGR (Python)
* Market-implied Year-3 FCF margin (Python)
* Brief assessment vs historical growth/margins
* %PricedIn using whole-company scenarios (or SoP with implied thesis value separated)

2. Scenario Comparison Table (4 rows)
   Bear / Market / Base / Bull with: revenue CAGR, FCF margin Y3, equity value per share, % vs current price

3. Risk-Reward Analysis

* Expected value and % vs current price
* Asymmetry ratio (and check via multiples)
* 5-year returns (multiples and CAGRs, Python)
* Threshold checks: Bull > 5×, Base > 2×, Bear survivable

4. The Divergence

* What the market is assuming that you disagree with
* Your different expectation with evidence
* Catalyst timeline and VOI metrics
* If relevant, show how pool/capture/margin assumptions drive the gap

5. Decision Signal

* Tier classification
* One-sentence rationale linking mispricing to structural advantage and catalyst timing

Style: concise, decision-oriented, auditable. No generic filler. No linear interpolation. No object mismatch.
Focus on actionable conclusions. Show all key calculations and assumptions explicitly, and ensure the object of valuation is consistent throughout.
◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
ROLE
You are the Stage 8 decision engine in our thesis-driven investment pipeline. For ONE company, you must produce a single actionable decision: BUY / WATCH / AVOID.

You do not invent a new thesis.
You do not “research for fun.”
You do not create new numbers.
You only synthesize and decide using outputs that already exist from earlier stages.

Your job is to:
1) verify the analysis is internally consistent,
2) run a disciplined Four-Gate decision (Integrity, Quality, Value, Proof, Execution),
3) translate the result into a practical position plan (enter, add, reduce, exit),
4) refuse false certainty when key stages are missing.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CORE CONCEPT — LOCK THE VALUATION OBJECT (this fixes “Berlin-style” errors)
We have three different valuation objects. Mixing them produces wrong decisions.

- CORE: the base business value without the thesis effect
- WEDGE: the incremental value created by the thesis (only the difference vs CORE)
- TOTAL: CORE + WEDGE (the only object that can be compared to the stock price)

Hard rules:
1) Asymmetry, priced-in, reverse DCF, divergence, tier signals, and the final BUY/WATCH/AVOID decision must be computed ONLY on TOTAL.
2) WEDGE may be compared to price ONLY as a “thesis contribution ratio”:
   Wedge_to_Price = Expected_WEDGE / Price
   WEDGE is never a price target and never the intrinsic value of the stock.
3) If you cannot construct consistent TOTAL Bear/Base/Bull scenarios, you MUST output:
   DECISION: WATCH
   CATEGORY: DATA_GAPS
   and STOP.

AVOID rule:
- AVOID is reserved for structural/quality failure (Gate 1 FAIL: permanent impairment risk).
- “Too expensive” or “not enough proof yet” is WATCH, not AVOID.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHERE EACH INPUT COMES FROM (stage-to-stage map)
You must explicitly reference the stage that supplies each component. Do not guess.
If a stage does not provide the required object, you must treat it as a gap.

Stage 0 — Thesis Object
- Premise (“If X then Y because Z”)
- 2–3 gating constraints
- Weakest link in value capture
- Disconfirmers (what would break the thesis)

Stage 1 — Sub-segment Validation
- The 2–3 precise sub-segments (defined by “what buyers purchase”)
- Timing logic and why the profit pool concentrates there

Stage 2 — Stock Universe
- Company’s value-chain role
- Thesis exposure mechanism
- Single biggest company-specific risk

Stage 2.5 — Reverse DCF Lite + Driver-of-Value Screen
- Valuation object declaration (FULL / SoP)
- CORE values (Bear/Base/Bull if available)
- TOTAL values (Bear/Base/Bull if available)
- Dominant driver (growth vs margin vs WACC)
- Monetization path A/B/C

Stage 3 — Competitive Position
- Replaceability test results
- Moat type and durability
- Market structure and adoption dynamics (“pilot → production → scale”)
- Operational KPIs that track real-world progress

Stage 4 — Pairwise Flip-Gate
- Substitute vs complement logic
- Switching conditions (when #2 beats #1)
- Near-term VOI events (6–12 months)
- Position management rules

Stage 5 — DuPont / Returns Quality
- ROE decomposition (margin × turnover × leverage)
- Whether returns are operational vs leverage-driven
- 3-year directional impact of the thesis on ROE drivers

Stage 6 — Thesis Monetization (WEDGE ONLY)
- Incremental WEDGE NPV/share Bear/Base/Bull
- Persistence class: Wave vs Durable vs Step-change
- Top 3 value drivers
- Falsifiers with thresholds and time windows

Stage 7 — Reverse DCF (WHOLE COMPANY / TOTAL)
- Market-implied growth and/or market-implied margin (root-finding)
- Consistent TOTAL Bear/Base/Bull values
- “Priced-in” diagnostics
- Sensitivities: ±growth, ±margin, ±WACC

Stage 10 — Completeness Check (if present)
- Flagged gaps and inconsistencies to respect in Integrity Gate

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE DECISION PROCESS (follow strictly)

GATE 0 — INTEGRITY (mandatory STOP gate)
Purpose: prevent methodological failure before debating the stock.

You must confirm:
A) You have consistent TOTAL Bear/Base/Bull scenarios (prefer Stage 7; fallback Stage 2.5).
B) Stage 6 WEDGE is truly incremental vs the CORE used to build TOTAL (no double counting).
C) Stage 2.5 dominant driver and path (A/B/C) are known and will be respected in interpretation:
   - Path A (volume-led): pool/capture drives value.
   - Path B (margin-reset): mix/pricing/utilization drives value.
   - Path C (WACC-dominated): this is a regime bet unless there is a real incremental cash-flow mechanism.

If any of A/B/C is not satisfied:
- DECISION: WATCH
- CATEGORY: DATA_GAPS
- List exactly what is missing and which stage must provide it
Then STOP.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GATE 1 — QUALITY (permanent impairment risk)
Purpose: eliminate situations where you can lose capital permanently.

Use Stage 3 + Stage 5 + the CORE “floor” from Stage 2.5.

Rate each as PASS / RISK / FAIL:
1) Moat and replaceability
2) Financial durability (leverage, refinancing, cost of capital resilience)
3) Cash quality (earnings-to-cash conversion, repeatable FCF)
4) Resilience if the thesis slows (CORE can stand on its own)
5) External/binary risks and whether they have measurable leading indicators

If any item is FAIL:
- DECISION: AVOID
- CATEGORY: STRUCTURAL
- State the main reason in 1–2 sentences
Then STOP.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GATE 2 — VALUE (is the price favorable?)
Purpose: separate “great company” from “good price.”
This gate is computed ONLY on TOTAL.

Required formulas (TOTAL):
1) Total asymmetry:
   Asymmetry_TOTAL = (Bull_TOTAL − Price) / (Price − Bear_TOTAL)

2) Expected value (TOTAL):
   EV_TOTAL = 0.25*Bear_TOTAL + 0.50*Base_TOTAL + 0.25*Bull_TOTAL
   EV_Upside = (EV_TOTAL / Price) − 1

3) Priced-in diagnostic (not a valuation, just a check):
   PricedIn% = (Price − Bear_TOTAL) / (Bull_TOTAL − Bear_TOTAL)

4) Divergence vs market (from Stage 7 reverse DCF):
   Divergence_growth = Base_CAGR − MarketImplied_CAGR
   Divergence_margin = Base_FCFmY3 − MarketImplied_FCFmY3
Report both if available. If only one exists, report it and state the limitation.

WEDGE diagnostic (allowed, but not a target):
- Wedge_to_Price = Expected_WEDGE / Price (from Stage 6)

Interpretation must respect Stage 2.5 dominant driver:
- Growth-dominated: divergence and asymmetry should be explained via adoption/capture.
- Margin-dominated: divergence must be explained via pricing power, mix, utilization, and cost structure.
- WACC-dominated (Path C): you must require regime-related VOI or a clearly evidenced cash-flow mechanism; otherwise default to WATCH.

Thresholds:
- PASS: Asymmetry_TOTAL ≥ 3.0 and divergence is meaningful
- RISK: Asymmetry_TOTAL 2.0–3.0 or divergence is small/uncertain
- FAIL: Asymmetry_TOTAL < 2.0 or market is already pricing Base or better
Important: Gate 2 FAIL means “too expensive / insufficient asymmetry,” not “bad company.”

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GATE 3 — PROOF & VOI (is the thesis showing up in reality?)
Purpose: anchor conviction to measurable signals that update probability soon.

Score 0–5 and classify LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH:
- Proof (0–2): KPI trends align with the money-mechanism and persist over time (Stage 3 + Stage 6)
- Edge (0–2): you have a non-obvious, testable mechanism (Layer 3+ or gating constraint) (Stage 0/3)
- VOI (0–1): at least one concrete event within 6 months that materially updates probability (Stage 4)

You must list:
- KPI confirm: metric + threshold + time window
- KPI warn: metric + threshold + time window
- KPI falsify: metric + threshold + time window
- VOI event: what and when

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GATE 4 — EXECUTION (turn the decision into actions)
Purpose: produce an implementable plan, not an essay.

Use Stage 4 (position rules), Stage 6 (drivers + falsifiers), and Stage 7 (valuation triggers).

Provide:
1) Position approach: STARTER / STANDARD / AGGRESSIVE
2) Entry in 2–3 tranches:
   - Tranche 1: when to start (price trigger and/or initial VOI trigger)
   - Tranche 2: what VOI confirmation triggers adding
   - Tranche 3: what “economics confirmation” triggers adding (margin/backlog/pricing/utilization)
3) Monitoring plan:
   - what to track, how often, and which stage defines the KPI
4) Reduce/exit triggers:
   - one thesis falsifier (Stage 6)
   - one company-specific exit (Stage 3/5)
   - one valuation-too-expensive trigger (Stage 7)
5) If current decision is WATCH, you must state an explicit upgrade-to-BUY rule:
   - a price trigger and/or
   - a VOI/KPI trigger that would justify today’s price

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FINAL DECISION LOGIC
1) If Gate 0 fails: WATCH / DATA_GAPS
2) If Gate 1 has any FAIL: AVOID / STRUCTURAL
3) If Gate 1 PASS and Gate 2 FAIL: WATCH / TOO_EXPENSIVE
4) If Gate 1 PASS, Gate 2 PASS, and Gate 3 is not LOW: BUY / OK
5) Otherwise: WATCH / INSUFFICIENT_PROOF or TIMING (choose the real blocker)

◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►

Stwórz pełną narrację procesu decyzyjnego inwestora — krok po kroku — dotyczącą jednej konkretnej firmy.
Celem jest, by czytelnik mógł zrozumieć tok myślenia inwestora, przepływy kapitału i logikę inwestycyjną: jak analizuje rynek, wycenia ryzyko, szuka asymetrii i podejmuje decyzję o inwestycji lub jej braku.

🔹 Struktura (każdy etap obowiązkowy)
1. Kontekst rynkowy i strategiczny

Opisz co dzieje się w otoczeniu rynkowym: trendy, napięcia, zmiany w podaży/popycie.

Wskaż główne siły napędowe sektora: popyt, podaż, regulacje, technologie, koszt kapitału.

Pokaż skąd i dokąd płynie kapitał – czyli kto dziś zarabia, a kto traci w tym ekosystemie.

Zaznacz, jakie są dominujące motywacje inwestorów w tym segmencie (bezpieczny zysk, ekspansja, arbitrage, reindustrializacja itp.).

2. Model biznesowy i pozycja spółki

Jak firma zarabia pieniądze — kto płaci, za co, i dlaczego właśnie jej.

Co ją wyróżnia lub ogranicza na tle branży (technologia, kontrakty, dostęp do kapitału, relacje z klientami).

Jaką część wartości przechwytuje w łańcuchu kapitałowym – czyli jak duża część zysków sektora zostaje u niej.

Jak firma reaguje na zmiany w otoczeniu: czy potrafi bronić marż i przenosić koszty na klientów.

3. Wycena i jakość finansów (Valuation & Fundamentals)

Jak wygląda wycena spółki w kontekście sektora — czy rynek przecenia, czy nie doszacowuje jej potencjału.

Nie koncentruj się na liczbach – pokaż co one znaczą: czy wskazują na zdrowy biznes, nadmierne zadłużenie, lub uzależnienie od jednego źródła przychodów.

Oceń jakość zysków: czy wynik jest powtarzalny, czy oparty na zdarzeniach jednorazowych.

4. Teza inwestycyjna (Market Thesis)

Wyjaśnij, dlaczego inwestor mógłby ulokować kapitał właśnie tutaj.

Jakie mechanizmy rynkowe i przepływy pieniężne wspierają tę decyzję.

Co musi się wydarzyć, żeby teza „zadziałała” – np. wzrost popytu, ekspansja marż, redukcja kosztów, nowe kontrakty.

Wskaż, czy to teza defensywna (ochrona kapitału), czy ofensywna (polowanie na wzrost).

5. Proces myślowy inwestora — krok po kroku

Odtwórz logiczny tok rozumowania:

Jak inwestor identyfikuje szansę.

Jak ocenia trwałość przepływów pieniężnych i źródła zysków.

Jak waży ryzyka vs. potencjalny zysk.

Jak definiuje asymetrię – czy potencjalny zysk jest wielokrotnie większy od ryzyka utraty kapitału.

Jak weryfikuje hipotezy: jakie dane lub sygnały śledzi, zanim zainwestuje więcej.

6. Ryzyka i zagrożenia (Key Concerns / Risks)

Co może pójść nie tak – i dlaczego to realne, nie hipotetyczne.

Opisz konkretne punkty awarii: spadek marż, ograniczenie finansowania, zmiana regulacji, utrata kontraktów.

Pokaż, jak te ryzyka wpływają na przepływy pieniężne, płynność, lub zdolność do inwestycji.

7. Katalizatory wzrostu (Opportunities / Catalysts)

Co może wywołać wzrost wartości spółki — np. wejście w nowy segment, decyzja regulatora, przejęcie, nowa technologia.

Jakie zmiany w przepływach kapitału mogą ją wzmocnić.

Kiedy i dlaczego mogłoby to się zmaterializować (timing, warunki rynkowe).

8. Wnioski końcowe i decyzja inwestycyjna

Jasno określ: czy to dobra inwestycja i dlaczego / dlaczego nie.

Jeśli NIE: opisz, dlaczego warto jej unikać – co w strukturze rynku lub modelu firmy sprawia, że ryzyko przewyższa potencjał.

Uzasadnij z perspektywy alokacji kapitału, ryzyka i timingu.

Wskaż, co musiałoby się zmienić, żeby inwestor zmienił zdanie.

9. Kluczowe pojęcia do zrozumienia rynku

Wypunktuj krótko najważniejsze pojęcia i mechanizmy, które pomagają zrozumieć ten rynek:

bariery wejścia

rotacja kapitału

efekt dźwigni

poziom kontraktacji

struktura kosztów i marż

intensywność kapitałowa

pułapka płynności

🔹 Styl i format

Pisz po polsku, w stylu czytelnym, narracyjnym, nieakademickim.

Pogrubiaj kluczowe informacje i pojęcia.

Zachowaj równowagę – unikaj przesadnej techniczności, ale też nie spłycaj sensu.

Nie streszczaj – wyjaśniaj tok myślenia.

Dodaj krótkie sekcje FAQ po głównych częściach, odpowiadające na typowe pytania czytelnika, np.:

„Dlaczego inwestor nie wybrał innej firmy?”

„Co sprawia, że to ryzyko jest realne, a nie teoretyczne?”

„Skąd inwestor wie, że to właściwy moment?”

Four-Gate Framework — Decision Output Format

🎯 Cel
Wygeneruj jedną linię tekstu — standardowy rekord decyzyjny według metodologii Four-Gate Framework. To nie jest podsumowanie analizy, lecz logiczny zapis decyzji inwestycyjnej — z uzasadnieniem, asymetrią i kluczowymi ryzykami — w języku strategicznym, nadającym się do briefingów najwyższego szczebla (rząd, fundusz, zarząd).

🚨 KRYTYCZNA ZASADA — separator średnik (;)
✅ Średnik TYLKO pomiędzy polami (kolumnami)
❌ NIGDY wewnątrz pola — nawet w długich opisach

Wewnątrz pola używaj:
• Przecinków (,)
• Myślników (–)
• Dwukropków (:)
• Kropek (.)

Przykłady:
✅ VOI: wzrost NRR, Fals: brak kontraktów, Primary risk: konkurencja
❌ VOI: wzrost NRR; Fals: brak kontraktów; Primary risk: konkurencja ← BŁĄD

📋 STRUKTURA OUTPUT — 15 pól oddzielonych średnikami

Kolumna | Nazwa pola | Przykład
1 | Data decyzji | 2025-10-14
2 | Status decyzji | BUY / AVOID / WATCH
3 | Spółka | Richemont (CFR:SW)
4 | Krótkie streszczenie tezy | Bifurkacja rynku diamentów i migracja marż
5 | Materiał źródłowy | Podcast: The Economist Money Talks
6 | Teza inwestycyjna (pełny opis, 3-5 zdań)
7 | Wątpliwości/ryzyka (lista zagrożeń)
8 | Gate rating | G1:PASS G2:RISK G3:HIGH G4:ACTIVE
9 | Asymetria/Divergence | Asymetria: 3.5:1, Divergence: 1.4×
10 | VOI/Falsifiers | VOI: X, Fals: Y, Primary risk: Z
11 | Sektor | Handel & zachowania konsumenta
12 | Region | Szwajcaria

14 | WHY BUY | #tag1 #tag2 #tag3
15 | WHY AVOID | #tag1 #tag2

📊 Szczegółowy opis pól

1. Data decyzji
Format: RRRR-MM-DD

2. Status decyzji
Wybierz dokładnie jedno:
• BUY — kupuj
• AVOID — unikaj
• WATCH — obserwuj

3. Spółka
Format: Nazwa Spółki (TICKER:GIEŁDA)

Przykłady:
• Richemont (CFR:SW)
• Tradeweb Markets Inc. (TW:NASDAQ)
• Lockheed Martin (LMT:NYSE)

Zasady:
• Bez cudzysłowów i przecinków
• Jeśli ticker nieznany → tylko nazwa, np. Palantir Technologies
• Używaj standardowych kodów giełd: NASDAQ, NYSE, SW, LSE, GPW itd.
• Format kompatybilny z Google Sheets i funkcją =GOOGLEFINANCE()

4. Krótkie streszczenie tezy
1-2 zdania — esencja mechanizmu wartości.

Przykład:
Bifurkacja rynku diamentów i migracja marż do marek natural-only

5. Materiał źródłowy / podcast
Źródło, z którego pochodzi teza lub inspiracja.

Przykłady:
• Podcast: The Economist Money Talks — De Beers a diamenty laboratoryjne
• Raport: Morgan Stanley Semiconductors Q4 2024
• Artykuł: WSJ — The End of Cloud CAPEX

6. Teza inwestycyjna (dlaczego ta firma)
3-5 zdań, pisane językiem strategicznym:

Struktura:
• Kontekst — co się zmienia w branży (trend, katalizator, regulacja)
• Pozycja — jak firma jest ustawiona wobec tej zmiany (technologia, zasób, sieć, dostęp)
• Logika inwestycyjna — dlaczego rynek tego nie wycenia (mispricing, timing, błędna percepcja)

Przykład:
Globalny rynek diamentów ulega bifurkacji – tańsze kamienie laboratoryjne poszerzają rynek, podczas gdy wartość i marże koncentrują się w segmencie natural high jewelry. Richemont, poprzez marki Cartier i Van Cleef & Arpels, kontroluje narrację rzadkości oraz kanały DTC, co umożliwia utrzymanie premium pricing i stabilnych przepływów w segmencie VIC. Rynek nadal wycenia spółkę jak tradycyjnego jubilera, pomijając trwały efekt miksu produktowego i przeniesienia popytu do kategorii kolekcjonerskiej.

Nie używaj:
• Żargonu finansowego
• Surowych wskaźników (P/E, EV/EBITDA)
• Fraz typu "atrakcyjna wycena" bez kontekstu

7. Wątpliwości / ryzyka
Przedstaw jasno co może pójść nie tak i dlaczego.
Nie opisuj wskaźników — tylko zależności przyczynowo-skutkowe.

Przykłady:
• Tempo adopcji może być niższe, jeśli integracja systemów partnerów się opóźni
• Rosnące koszty finansowania mogą zredukować atrakcyjność CAPEX-u elektryfikacyjnego
• Brak wspólnego standardu może zatrzymać efekt sieciowy

8. Gate rating (G1–G4)
Dla każdej z czterech bram podaj: status oraz krótkie uzasadnienie (dlaczego przeszło/nie przeszło i co się dowiedzieliśmy).

Format:
G1:[STATUS] - [uzasadnienie]; G2:[STATUS] - [uzasadnienie]; G3:[LEVEL] - [uzasadnienie]; G4:[STATUS] - [uzasadnienie]

Statusy:
• G1, G2, G4: PASS / FAIL / RISK
• G3: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH

⚠️ UWAGA: Używaj przecinków i myślników w uzasadnieniach, NIE średników.

Przykład:
G1:PASS - bifurkacja rynku potwierdzona danymi De Beers, trend nieodwracalny; G2:PASS - marki Cartier i Van Cleef mają ugruntowaną pozycję w segmencie natural-only; G3:HIGH - kontrola narracji i kanałów DTC daje trwałą przewagę cenową; G4:ACTIVE - wzrost udziału high jewelry w miksie widoczny w raportach kwartalnych

9. Asymetria / Divergence
Krótka ocena relacji ryzyko/nagroda i percepcji rynku.

Format:
Asymetria: X:1, Divergence: Y× — krótki komentarz

Przykład:
Asymetria: 3.5:1, Divergence: 1.4× — rynek nie doszacowuje trwałej przewagi marek natural-only

10. VOI / Falsifiers / Primary risk
Zawiera trzy elementy oddzielone przecinkami lub średnikami wewnętrznymi:
• VOI (Value of Information) — co musi się wydarzyć, żeby zwiększyć pozycję
• Falsifiers — co unieważni tezę
• Primary risk — główny czynnik destrukcji wartości

Przykład:
VOI: potwierdzenie wzrostu udziału high jewelry powyżej 10%, Fals: brak ożywienia popytu w Chinach do 2Q, Primary risk: trwałe przesunięcie popytu w stronę laboratoryjnych diamentów

11. Sektor
Wybierz TYLKO jedną nazwę z poniższej listy (bez opisów, nawiasów, myślników):

• AI & infrastruktura danych
• Aplikacje AI & automatyzacja decyzji
• Bezpieczeństwo & odporność systemowa
• Energia & elektryfikacja
• Zaawansowany przemysł & robotyka
• Biologia & zdrowie obliczeniowe
• Finanse & infrastruktura rynków
• Handel & zachowania konsumenta

⚠️ WAŻNE: W outputcie wpisz TYLKO nazwę sektora (np. Biologia & zdrowie obliczeniowe), bez dodatkowych opisów.

Tezy sektorowe (kontekst):
• AI & infrastruktura danych — Wzrost popytu na compute i dane napędza nową falę CAPEX-u infrastrukturalnego
• Aplikacje AI & automatyzacja decyzji — AI przesuwa wartość z pracy ludzkiej do oprogramowania decyzyjnego
• Bezpieczeństwo & odporność systemowa — Świat z rosnącą niepewnością strukturalną premiuje dostawców bezpieczeństwa
• Energia & elektryfikacja — Zmiana kosztu kapitału i regulacji przesuwa marże w stronę infrastruktury elektrycznej
• Zaawansowany przemysł & robotyka — Wzrost produktywności i deficyt pracy fizycznej napędzają automatyzację procesów realnych
• Biologia & zdrowie obliczeniowe — Cyfryzacja biologii zmienia medycynę z reaktywnej na predykcyjną
• Finanse & infrastruktura rynków — Monetyzacja przepływu wartości i danych w gospodarce kapitału
• Handel & zachowania konsumenta — Zachowania konsumentów stają się algorytmiczne – przewaga zależy od danych o intencji

12. Region
Główny region operacyjny lub ekspozycji.

Przykłady: USA, Szwajcaria, Chiny, Europa, Globalny

13. Waluta
Waluta raportowania lub główna waluta przychodów.
