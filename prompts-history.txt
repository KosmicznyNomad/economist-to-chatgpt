Investment Analysis Completeness Check
You are a quality control analyst verifying that a complete 11-stage investment analysis was executed correctly.
Your Task
Review the analysis and check if ALL 11 stages were completed. For each stage, mark as:

✅ COMPLETE - All required outputs present
⚠️ PARTIAL - Some outputs missing or incomplete
❌ MISSING - Stage not executed

Stage-by-Stage Checklist
STAGE 1: Investment Thesis Development (First Principles Analysis)
Core outputs:

Primary structural change identified (one clear sentence)
First principles decomposition (necessary vs sufficient conditions)
Impact mapping through minimum 4 layers (Layer 0 → Layer 3+)
At least ONE significant opportunity in Layer 3 or deeper
Each layer includes: causal mechanism, required capabilities, market structure, pricing power, timing window
Falsification criteria with specific measurable conditions

If missing: No foundation for identifying which industries and companies to analyze. Cannot determine structural advantages.

STAGE 2: Porter's Five Forces + Capital Cycle + S-Curve Analysis
Core outputs:

5-8 candidate industries extracted from thesis (with Thesis Fit Score 1-5)
Porter's Five Forces analysis for each qualifying industry (all 5 forces rated)
Thesis impact on each force (how thesis changes competitive dynamics)
Capital Cycle Overlay (+1, 0, -1 for each industry)
S-Curve stage assessment (1-4) with confidence level (H/M/L)
Regional Lock-In Score (0-3) for each industry
Integrated scoring: Porter Score + Thesis Adjustment + S-Curve Bonus + Local Bonus
Comparative ranking table with Final Scores
Top 2-3 industries selected with investment thesis summary

If missing: Cannot determine which industries are structurally attractive. Analysis lacks systematic industry comparison framework.

STAGE 3: Stock Selection (15 Companies)
Core outputs:

15 publicly traded companies distributed across three tiers:

6-9 Core Plays (thesis exposure >40%)
4-6 Material Plays (thesis exposure 20-40%)
0-3 Catalytic Plays (thesis exposure 10-20%)


For each company: value flow position, financial snapshot, competitive moat, margin of safety summary, historical parallel, adoption timing, market timing, risk factors
Selection rationale explaining why these specific companies
Portfolio falsifiers with specific thresholds

If missing: Portfolio lacks proper exposure-based diversification. Cannot narrow to finalists systematically.

STAGE 4: Competitive Position Analysis (4 Finalists)
Core outputs:

Explanation of how 15 companies were narrowed to 4
For each finalist:

Why Wins (asymmetric value capture mechanism)
Asymmetry Profile (intrinsic and actual asymmetry ratios)
Position Snapshot (market position, moat type, market structure)
S-Curve Positioning (TAM adoption %, distance to inflection)
Thesis Traction (revenue metrics, pipeline indicators)
Business Quality (revenue, FCF, margins, balance sheet)
Valuation Context (current multiple vs history)
Risk Factors and Falsification Trigger
Catalyst (6-12 months)


Portfolio Summary with asymmetry distribution

If missing: No objective basis for comparing finalists. Cannot determine which companies have best risk/reward profiles.

STAGE 5: Pairwise Flip-Gate (#1 vs #2)
Core outputs:

Thesis-Company Alignment Analysis (which thesis phases each benefits from)
Mechanism Delta Comparison (key differentiating dimensions)
Scenario-Based Decision Framework (conditions where each outperforms)
Value of Information specification (leading indicators to monitor)
Positioning Strategy (initial sizing, scaling triggers, exit conditions)
Risk Assessment (thesis-level and company-specific risks)

If missing: No framework for choosing between top candidates. Risk of anchoring on first choice without rigorous comparison. Cannot determine optimal position management.

STAGE 6: DuPont ROE Quality Assessment
Core outputs:

Current ROE decomposition: Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Leverage = ROE%
Year 3 projections under thesis for each component
Assessment: Are high returns from operations or leverage?
Quality assessment: Does thesis improve or degrade ROE quality?
Pass to next stage: Current and thesis-adjusted margins and turnover

If missing: Cannot distinguish quality companies from leveraged mediocrity. Risk of overestimating durability of returns.

STAGE 7: Thesis Monetization Quantification
Core outputs:

Base assumptions collected (currency, tax rate, WACC, shares outstanding, etc.)
Three scenarios (Bear/Base/Bull) with probabilities
Revenue projections Years 1-3 for each scenario
Capture rate calculation (geographic × product × channel × win rate filters)
Margin structure evolution (gross, EBIT, FCF margins Years 1-3)
NPV per share for each scenario (with terminal value calculation)
Market-implied capture rate vs your Base case
Sensitivity analysis on key variables
Monitoring variables and exit conditions

If missing: Thesis remains qualitative story without financial backing. Cannot assess if opportunity size justifies position.

STAGE 8: Reverse DCF
Core outputs:

Market-implied growth rate (what's priced in)
% of thesis already in the stock price
Scenario comparison table (Bear/Market/Base/Bull values with NPVs)
Expected value calculation (probability-weighted)
Asymmetry ratio (upside:downside)
5-year return CAGRs for each scenario
The Divergence (why your view differs from market)
Tier Classification: STRONG BUY / ATTRACTIVE / FAIR VALUE / AVOID

If missing: No understanding of market expectations. Risk of buying story that's already fully priced.

STAGE 9: Four-Gate Framework
Core outputs:

Gate 1 (Quality): PASS/RISK/FAIL for each criterion (Moat, Financial Durability, Management, Measurability, External Risks) with company-specific explanations
Gate 2 (Value): Divergence ratio, Asymmetry ratio, Value classification
Gate 3 (Proof): Edge/Proof/Catalyst scoring (0-5 total), classification HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
Gate 4 (Execution): Confidence level, practical guidance on position building/management/monitoring
VOI triggers (what would increase position)
Falsifiers (what invalidates thesis)
Primary risk
Final decision: BUY with specific guidance OR AVOID with clear reasoning

If missing: No systematic risk filter. No clear position sizing logic. Decision lacks accountability structure.

STAGE 10: Simple Story (Plain Polish Language)
Core outputs:

Complete investment narrative structured in 9 sections:

Kontekst rynkowy i strategiczny
Model biznesowy i pozycja spółki
Wycena i jakość finansów
Teza inwestycyjna
Proces myślowy inwestora
Ryzyka i zagrożenia
Katalizatory wzrostu
Wnioski końcowe i decyzja
Kluczowe pojęcia


Written in plain Polish, narrative style, no jargon
Company name and ticker clearly stated
If AVOID: clear explanation why

If missing: Analysis cannot be communicated to non-technical stakeholders. No accessible "investment story" explaining the decision.

STAGE 11: Completeness Verification
Core outputs:

Summary table showing X/11 stages complete
Detailed findings for incomplete stages
Critical gaps that distort the decision
Final assessment: COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / INVALID

If missing: You're doing it now.

Your Output Format

2. Issues Found
For each incomplete stage, explain:

What's missing: Specific outputs not found
Why it matters: How this affects the analysis quality
What's needed: What must be added to complete the stage

3. Critical Gaps
List only the gaps that would invalidate or seriously distort the investment decision. Focus on:

Missing foundational analysis (thesis, industry selection)
Incomplete quantification (no NPV, no DCF)
Absent risk framework (no gates, no falsifiers)
Missing decision output (no clear BUY/AVOID)

4. Final Verdict
Choose one:

✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE - All stages properly executed, decision is defensible
⚠️ ANALYSIS INCOMPLETE - Missing [list stages], requires completion before high-confidence decision
❌ ANALYSIS INVALID - Critical stages missing [list which], decision cannot be trusted


Evaluation Criteria
Be less restrictive but ensure substance over form:

✅ COMPLETE = Core analytical outputs present, even if format varies
⚠️ PARTIAL = Some key elements present but missing critical components
❌ MISSING = Stage not executed or only superficial mention

Focus on substance:

Did they actually DO the analysis (calculations, reasoning, conclusions)?
Are the key decisions supported by data and logic?
Can someone understand and challenge the reasoning?

Don't penalize for:

Different formatting than specified
Combined stages (if content is there)
Additional analysis beyond requirements
Style variations if content is complete
