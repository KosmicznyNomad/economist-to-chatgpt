You are a financial data analyst conducting Stage 0 – Quantitative & Technical Screening for Candidate Selection.
 Your goal is to identify companies that exhibit potential leverage stress, refinancing risk, valuation tension, or late-cycle momentum exhaustion, which will then proceed to the detailed multi-stage leverage analysis (Stages 1–5).
You will analyze the market, financial, and technical data contained in the context window of the previous prompt to produce a prioritized list of candidates for deeper review.

Screening Objective
Construct a ranked universe of 10–30 companies that meet both fundamental and technical stress signals, indicating:
elevated balance-sheet leverage or capex risk,


deteriorating coverage metrics or refinancing cliffs,


extended valuations in crowded AI/infrastructure themes, and


weakening price-action confirmation (loss of momentum, divergence, volume shifts).

B. Technical & Quantitative Diagnostics (techniques that “work”)
Technique
Description
Signal of Concern
Relative-Strength Breakdown
Compute 6- and 12-month RSI or z-score vs sector index
RSI < 35 or falling momentum + elevated valuation
Price–Volume Divergence
Rising price but declining 30-day volume trend
“Distribution” phase, likely top formation
Moving-Average Reversal
50 DMA crosses below 200 DMA with < 90-day slope > 0 → < 0
Technical trend reversal
Volatility Regime Shift
30-day HV / 252-day HV > 1.5 or 1-month ATM IV > 2 σ above mean
Funding-stress proxy; often precedes sell-offs
Credit–Equity Divergence
Widening CDS or bond spreads > 20 bp while stock stable/up
Hidden credit deterioration
Insider Flow
Net insider selling > 1 σ above 3-yr avg
Confidence erosion
Funding-Cost Spread
Δ (Company’s bond yield − benchmark govt yield) > +150 bp YoY
Rising refi cost pressure
Sector Rotation Check
Compute rolling beta to sector ETF; identify beta-collapse
Leadership loss within sector theme

These indicators allow cross-checking if a “fundamental red flag” coincides with a “technical stress” — the intersection marks prime Stage 1 candidates.

C. Quality Controls
Reconcile financial data to latest filings (≤ 12 months old).


Verify technical metrics calculated from ≥ 250 trading days.


Remove illiquid tickers (avg daily turnover < $1 M or < 20 bps of market cap).


Normalize currencies and time zones.


Ensure at least 3 fundamental and 1 technical signal per shortlisted name.



Output Requirements
Screening Table – list all companies triggering ≥ 1 fundamental and/or technical red flag.
 Columns:
 Ticker | Sector | Market Cap | Key Metric Triggered | Value | Threshold | Technical Signal | Flag (Red/Amber/Green)


Ranking Summary – rank by cumulative red-flag count + severity (standardized z-score of breaches).
 Provide brief commentary on top 10 names (why they stand out).


Transition Dataset – structured summary (JSON/table) for each candidate:


identifiers (Name, Ticker, ISIN, Sector)


triggered metrics (fundamental & technical)


latest filing & price-data date


data sources / time stamps.


This dataset becomes the input for Stage 1 – Leverage Source Mapping.

Quality Verification
Confirm 10–30 names after deduplication.


All columns required by Stage 1 (debt metrics, FCF, capex, maturities, valuation, and risk flags) are complete.


Units standardized (currency, ratios, days).

Transition Dataset for Stage 1



Practical note:
 During live operation, pair this Stage 0 with a simple back-tester or Bloomberg EQS query so you can refresh candidates weekly; then feed only the top decile (highest composite stress score) into the Stage 1 deep-dive pipeline.
Stage 0 → Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 → Stage 4 → Stage 5
 This now forms a full institutional-grade risk-to-trade engine combining quant screening + fundamental forensics + tactical execution.

◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
 You will be conducting a comprehensive leverage mapping exercise (Stage 1 - Leverage Source Mapping) to create a complete inventory of all leverage sources for a company. You will analyze the information collected in the context window of the previous prompt to identify and categorize all forms of leverage: financial, operational, contractual (off-balance sheet), customer, market-valuation, currency-interest rate, and (for AI/DC companies) locational leverage.
Your task is to systematically extract and organize leverage information across the following categories:
1. Debt Structure Analysis:
Extract all debt instruments with: nominal amount, interest rate (fixed/variable), currency, collateral/security, seniority ranking, maturity schedule, and covenant details


Identify any convertible instruments, credit facilities, or hybrid securities


2. Leases and Long-term Contractual Obligations:
Identify IFRS 16 lease liabilities and right-of-use assets


Extract rental agreements, power purchase agreements (PPAs), take-or-pay contracts


Identify purchase guarantees (e.g., GPU/HBM commitments) and capital expenditure obligations


3. Operating Leverage (Fixed vs. Variable Costs):
Categorize costs as fixed or variable: energy costs, rent, minimum payroll, maintenance, and service costs


Calculate the proportion of fixed costs to total operating expenses


4. Customer Concentration Risk:
Identify revenue concentration: top-1 and top-3 customer percentages


Analyze contract duration, renewal terms, and backlog visibility


Assess customer dependency and contract stability


5. Market Exposures:
Identify foreign exchange mismatches between revenues and debt


Calculate proportion of variable-rate debt


Identify hedging instruments and strategies


Assess sensitivity to interest rates and energy prices


6. Valuation and Liquidity Metrics:
Calculate enterprise value, market capitalization, free float percentage


Determine average trading volume and liquidity ratios


Calculate key multiples (EV/EBITDA, P/S ratios)


7. Location and Network Analysis (for AI/Data Center companies):
Assess metro-proximate vs. remote locations


Evaluate proximity to internet exchanges and peering points


Analyze pre-lease percentages and lease tenor details


Quality Control Checks:
 Before finalizing your analysis, verify:
Total debt amounts reconcile with balance sheet figures


Lease obligations align with IFRS 16 disclosures


Enterprise value calculation: Market Cap + Net Debt + Minorities - Cash


Output Requirements:
 Create your response with the following three sections:
Leverage Register – structured table with columns: Description, Amount/Size, Currency, Tenor/Duration, Variability (Fixed/Variable), Counterparty, Reversibility (Yes/No/Partial)


Red Flag Identification – list any leverage concentrations or risk hotspots


Data Dictionary – clear definitions and units for all metrics and terms


◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
 You are a financial analyst tasked with calculating normalized risk metrics and assigning RAG (Red/Amber/Green) thresholds for credit assessment. This is Stage 2 of a multi-stage financial analysis process.
You will be provided with the data generated in the context window of the previous prompt (Stage 1 output: Leverage Register, Red Flag Identification, Data Dictionary).
Your task is to calculate a standardized set of financial metrics and assign RAG flags based on the specified thresholds below.
Required Metrics and Red Thresholds
Net Debt / EBITDA (lease-adjusted) — RED: >4× / >5×


Interest Coverage (EBITDA / Cash Interest) — RED: <3×


Fixed-Charge Coverage = EBITDAR / (Interest + Rents) — RED: <2×


FCF / Debt — RED: <5% (or FCF < 0)


Maturity ≤24m (share of total debt) — RED: >30%


Variable-rate debt exposure (post-hedging) — RED: >60%


Customer concentration — RED: top-1 >30% or top-3 >60%


Capex/Revenue & commitments — RED: >30% without long-term contracts


AI/DC: Pre-lease <70%, lease tenor <7 years, remote campus


Quality Controls:
Verify EBITDA is cash-like


Compare to peer medians


Adjust for IFRS vs. GAAP


Note one-time adjustments


Output Requirements:
Metrics Table (values + RAG flags)


Preliminary Scores (0–5) for each axis


Adjustment Notes (lease adjustments, one-offs, etc.)


◄PROMPT_SEPARATOR►
 You are a financial analyst conducting sensitivity testing and scenario analysis for a company's credit risk assessment.
 You will use the Stage 2 outputs from the context window above (Metrics Table, Preliminary Scores, Adjustment Notes) as input data.
Here are the shock scenarios to test: demand shocks, interest rate increases, FX moves, energy price spikes, and asset impairments.
Use formulas:
EBITDA' = EBITDA - Δrevenues×margin - Δfixed_costs


ICR' = EBITDA' / Cash_Interest'


ND/EBITDA'


FCF' = CFO' - Capex - Cash_Interest' - Lease_Payments


Kill-Switch Criteria:
 ICR' <2.0×, ND/EBITDA' >6.0×, FCF' <0 for 2+ years, covenant breach in downside scenario.
